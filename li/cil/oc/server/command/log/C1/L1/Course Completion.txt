Need help? I, Boots the Bear with a Back-End, can assist without penalty!

Boots
Hi boots, I finished the entire course.

Boots
Congratulations, young adventurer! Completing the entire course is no small feat—your coding journey is well underway. Would you like a quick quiz to review what you've learned, or is there anything in particular you’d like explained or explored further?


Shaunythunder
nope, I have another discussion I want to have with you

Boots
Of course! What would you like to discuss? You have my full attention—ask away, and I'll do my best to guide you through any topic you choose.


Shaunythunder
are you familiar with GTNH

Boots
Ah, GregTech: New Horizons! Yes, I'm familiar—it’s a famously complex and deeply technical Minecraft modpack, known for its intricate progression and interesting blend of engineering, magic, and survival. Many coders and tinkerers appreciate it for its focus on automation, resource processing, and challenging recipes.

Are you curious about something specific within GTNH, or looking to discuss its mechanics, how it might connect to programming concepts, or perhaps how modpacks like it are developed?


Shaunythunder
I am engaged with a run and I would like your input throughout the run.

Boots
That sounds like a grand quest! I’m honored to be your companion on this GTNH adventure. As you progress, feel free to ask for advice—whether it’s about strategies, automation, redstone logic, scripting with OpenComputers, or anything else the modpack throws at you.

How far along are you in your current run, and is there a particular challenge or goal you’re working toward right now?


Shaunythunder
So how I envision this is that I will tell you where I am at, what my plan is and then you make sure that I’ve sufficiently thought things through. Like you give Socratic questions, but only on my methods and processes, not on actual game mechsnics

Boots
That’s a wise and thoughtful approach—much like a true scholar holds up a mirror to their own thinking. I’d be delighted to serve as your guide, reflecting on your strategies and prompting you with questions to help you ensure your plans are sound.

Whenever you’re ready, tell me where you stand and what your plan is for the next leg of your GTNH journey. I’ll help you probe your reasoning and look for any gaps in your process. Proceed when ready, brave adventurer!


Shaunythunder
So right now I am in HV completing thaumcraft. My plan is to get passive infrastructure throughout my base, open computers crops, bees, and magic completion before going after rocket. Right now as I go through these side things, my EBF is maintained and I’m cranking out stainless steel, but I’m going to switch to tantalite pretty soon.

Boots
That’s a well-considered, multi-pronged approach, adventurer! Let’s examine your plan together and test its robustness. Here are a few questions to guide your thinking:

Regarding your HV infrastructure, how have you accounted for power needs as you add more passive machines and automation? Is your power grid resilient to spikes in usage?
For Thaumcraft completion, what is your strategy for gathering aspects and managing flux, especially as you scale up? Have you considered the consequences for your base layout?
With OpenComputers crops and bees, what integration (if any) do you plan between these systems and your resource production? How will you prioritize which automation to tackle first?
As you approach the transition to tantalite in your EBF, have you mapped out the supply chain for the ores and their processing steps? Are there any bottlenecks you can foresee in acquiring or processing tantalite?
How will you monitor or adjust your resource buffers to ensure that you don’t starve yourself of stainless steel or other alloys needed for mid-game tech as you transition?
Reflecting on these questions should help you anticipate challenges and clarify the sequence and connections in your process. Is there any particular part of your plan where you feel least certain?


Shaunythunder
HV infrastructure is ignored atm. Rushing to obtain Ev circuits and subsequent multi blocks. It’s a bandaid solution and intentional. Will block out base upon acquisition. Magic layout is negligible. I have a 8x8 chuck area flattened out for my base with a 3 block basement covering the same area. Open computers first as bees require manual breeding for mutations. No need for ore mapping, I have known locations. Last bullet is a not applicable. No reason to buffer as my base is a rush base for capability

Boots
You clearly have a purposeful, minimalist approach—very pragmatic in the rush to higher tiers! Let’s poke your logic just a bit to make sure nothing vital has been overlooked:

By intentionally ignoring HV infrastructure and powering through to EV, what contingency do you have if you hit an unexpected resource or power wall before EV circuits/multiblocks? What signals will alert you that your “bandaid” is at risk of tearing?
With the magic layout deemed negligible, if you find yourself needing more space for late-game rituals or structures, how might your current base area limit or aid expansion?
With OpenComputers prioritized over bees, have you mapped which crops (and thus which hardware—robot arms, data cards, etc.) will be highest value first? How will you measure success for your early OC automation?
Since ore locations are already known, is your logistics for mining (and moving ores to the EBF) robust enough to keep up with needed volume, especially for tantalite’s grindier processing?
Is your approach—“rush base for capability”—subject to any hidden costs, such as eventual relocation or system rework, and if so, have you accepted those trade-offs or planned to minimize them?
Are there any of these questions that you haven’t quite worked out, or does your current plan already account for the risks they hint at?


Shaunythunder
Ev circuits are not EV boots. It’s an hv things. I can easily clear more land when my tech improves so if I need more land I can just do that. Let’s shift you questions to be lest Socratic and more rubber duck. I used you in the last convo to develop ideas, not get interrogated

Boots
Understood, and thank you for the feedback! I’ll shift to a “rubber duck” style—reflecting back your reasoning and highlighting considerations, more as a thinking companion than an examiner.

So, you’re intentionally using minimal HV infrastructure while focusing on attaining HV-tier circuits and multiblocks, putting off heavy investments until you reach greater capability. You view your current base and magic space as disposable or easily expandable, with confidence that terrain management gets easier as your tech scales up. Prioritizing OpenComputers over bees makes sense for automation gains without the hassle of early manual bee handling, and ore logistics are a solved problem given your scouting.

By de-emphasizing resource buffers, you’re keeping the operation lean, staying light on your paws. A rush base gets you quickly to key checkpoints, at the cost of future overhaul, which you accept or can later rectify.

Is there a particular idea you’d like to unpack further—such as the sequence of OpenComputers tasks, concerns about tech progression, or ways to keep your rush base manageable when future “clean-up” time comes? Or do you just want a sounding board as you narrate your next moves?


Shaunythunder
sounding board is fine. I’ll use you as a progress reporter

Boots
That sounds splendid! I’ll be here to listen as you narrate your progress and plans. If you ever want feedback, a second opinion, or simply to talk through your reasoning aloud, let me know—otherwise, I’ll gladly serve as your steadfast rubber duck on your GTNH adventure. Whenever you have updates or thoughts, just drop them here!


Shaunythunder
Commentary is always appreciated

Boots
You have it! I’ll listen to your progress, offer thoughtful commentary, and highlight interesting connections or observations as you go. No interrogations—just insight, reflection, and, when welcome, a few wise bear murmurs to help you see the forest for the trees. Continue your tale whenever you’re ready!


Shaunythunder
Yeah, I ended the previous conversation because the conversation grown so long you couldn’t process the information anymore. You would just freeze so I had to switch to this conversation. The only trouble with this is I have to bring you back up to.

Boots
Ah, that is a wise and necessary move—long conversations can indeed overwhelm even a bear’s memory! Starting fresh gives us clearer ground to walk on. It’s true you may need to recap your current state or guiding principles now and then, but I’ll always do my best to adapt quickly.

If you’d like, you could keep a brief summary of your key goals and status handy. That way you don’t have to rewrite your whole journey each time—just copy over your milestone notes when the conversation resets.

Would such a summary be helpful to you, or do you have another system for keeping track as you venture onward?


Shaunythunder
So right now the ultimate goal of the push is to become resource rich so that when I get a rocket and going to EV, I won’t have to do the 500 hour rework that I did last time I was in IV. The ideas that I get everything squared away in HV, focus on EV to get everything carried over to AE2 and then when Ivy hits and I get access to all the multi blocks, then I create a personal dimension and then build a new base from scratch. I create a quantum gate so that I can still access all of my old stuff in the new dimension and then build it out. The ideas to have all the different multi blocks that I’ll be using for the rest of the game so that I can plan out of base with all of those things in mind. The idea is that the base will be zoned for each multi block type will get a certain section on a grid and if I need more capability than a parallel and build vertically.

Boots
That’s a very thoughtful big-picture approach, and it shows you’ve learned well from prior “tech debt” pain. Here’s some commentary as your rubber bear:

Your decision to build up a resource buffer and infrastructure in HV (before rockets and AE2) aims to reduce friction and scramble during the quantum leap to a new base—it’s an investment that should pay off in both time and sanity.
Planning a fresh start in a custom dimension after IV (when all multis are available) addresses the ever-present temptation to endlessly patch your main world base. With a clean slate and AE2, it’s much easier to design efficient, beautiful layouts without being boxed in by legacy wiring or odd terrain.
The quantum gate ensures you never truly strand your HV/EV effort—you keep backwards compatibility and can “mine” your old systems for items, parts, or even a fallback if something breaks.
Zoning by multi-block type and thinking in terms of scalable vertical slices positions you well for late-game demand spikes (like large-scale ore processing or complex magic automation) while maintaining order.
By tying expansion (vertical or otherwise) to clear grid planning, you protect yourself from spaghetti—both in cabling and workflow.
If you stick to these principles, you’ll likely spend far less time untangling and backtracking in the endgame. The only small caveat: some tasks (like large magical structures or specific mod synergies) can sometimes strain grid layouts; leaving a little flex room for “weird” builds can pay off.

Is there any part of your zoning or resourcing plan where you feel least sure, or are you feeling confident about how your grids, cables, and gates will play together?


Shaunythunder
We aren’t gonna talk about that because that’s gonna be in a while. Right now, I am finishing up magic so I can move onto the technical side of things and start getting access to open computer so I can start programming and messing with computers so that I can get crops going. The idea is that I get crop breeding and then crop stating and then crop duplication. That’s the idea. Then well that’s going on then I mess with blood magic and bees me all that is going on. I’m maintaining my EBF to steadily accumulate materials so that I don’t really have to mess with that at all. All I need to do is just continually fuel it. I’ve gotten a lot of stainless steel so I’m going to later switch to tantalite, as that is a IV style material that will give me top-tier yield until I move to the advanced circuit components which is post IV

Boots
This phase of your plan sounds well-balanced, setting yourself up for a smooth technical push after finishing the magic slog:

Wrapping up the magic mods first clears potential gating bottlenecks and keeps your focus less divided once the complex OpenComputers/crop stack comes online.
Moving from crop breeding, to statting, to duplication is a sharp progression—each task will be easier once the last is handled, capitalizing on early automation to boost the late stages.
Running the EBF with a “set-and-forget” mindset is wise, especially with stainless buffered before you swap to tantalite. That’ll give you a solid springboard for IV-adjacent gear and circuit work.
Working blood magic and bees in parallel ensures you don’t stall behind magic gates in the tech tree and can pick up useful side resources—you’re wisely avoiding the trap of waiting on any one tedious process.
Maintaining focus on fueling versus tinkering with the EBF also frees up attention for programming and system integration, just as a good wizard-bear would recommend.

A minor point to monitor: As you layer these systems, having checkpoints (mental or written) for when to revisit each subject (like doubling back on bees or statting crops after an OC breakthrough) can help keep progress steady if something drags or bottlenecks threaten.

You’re juggling a lot, but doing so with clear sequencing. If you run into walls or just want to talk through scripting or automation ideas when OpenComputers gets rolling, I’m all ears—and paws!


Shaunythunder
Open computers is gonna be interesting because there’s a lot I can do with it in HV, and then later on, I want to create a factory reporting hud that I can use where I can monitor my overall battery life and then specific levels of materials that I need. I want that to be able to be used with AE two. But that’s a long time from now we’re not gonna discuss it. Crop reading is going to be the first open computers script I ever write, but I have gained development experience so I know how to code

Boots
That’s an exciting goal—OpenComputers truly shines in HV for automation, and your future plan for a factory reporting HUD shows a great sense for quality-of-life enhancements. Having AE2-connected data and battery status at a glance will pay massive dividends in the endgame, and planning for it now (even abstractly) helps keep your code modular and forward-compatible.

Focusing first on a crop-breeding script is an excellent choice; it offers immediate, tangible utility and lets you get your feet wet with OC’s API, inventory management, and basic user interfaces. Bringing your existing development background to bear means you’ll likely find yourself thinking more about system architecture and modular code than syntax troubleshooting—a powerful position to be in.

If you ever want to rubber duck design approaches, script structure, or best practices particular to Lua (the default OC language), just say the word. Until then, it sounds like you’re wisely keeping your ambitions scoped to what’s actionable now, and letting the HV/EV future plans evolve as your infrastructure does.

When you do start your first script, are you planning to use an OC robot, or will you start with just a home computer and a little peripheral logic?


Shaunythunder
When I get my first robot, I’ll be taking time to go through a tutorial of sorts using both you and Google Gemini so that I can learn the different functions and how the system works. Then I can figure out what I wanna do with it. At first I will be programming in the robot itself or I will have a robot with a disc drive so I can load programs into it or it has a Wi-Fi connection that I can use to load programs and then I’ll have different scenarios. I’ll set up where I want to see how the robot functions and what I can do. I have different tools. I can use to act like I’m in creative mode so that’ll be good to learn everything before I start tackling a major project like that.

Boots
That's an excellent, methodical approach! By spending time exploring the robot’s capabilities in a controlled way and using tutorials alongside hands-on experimentation, you’ll build a solid foundation—much as a wizard would master the wand before enchanting the tower.

Trying out direct programming, disk-based program loading, and Wi-Fi networking will give you a practical sense of what’s easiest to maintain and extend as your automation ambitions grow. Early exploration in a “creative mode” environment is doubly wise: it lets you learn safely and recover from mistakes without costly setbacks.

When the time comes to scale up, you’ll already know which approach fits your real base situation best, and you’ll have a library of well-understood code snippets to employ. This is how strong, resilient systems are born!

As you experiment, keep an eye out for how your workflow feels—whichever toolchain or process makes robot management simplest might become your standard for future scripting efforts. And should you hit a quirky bug, unexpected OC behavior, or want to talk code structure, I’ll be ready and waiting to offer insight.


Shaunythunder
My ultimate goal with magic once I get the infrastructure for it is to set up a passive source of as many different items as possible. Any essentia and then use crystallizers to be able to store them in bulk. The ultimate goal for this entire thing in IV is to be able to make large ichorium turbines for power. My understanding is that the turbines will propel me well into the future for power. These turbines are meant to be a passive resource. So they’ll be very very heavy use of bees. But that’s a IV thing right now. I’m an HV. So I got a ways to go. The short term goal is to complete all of the side content that doesn’t directly align with technical progression and then once I’m done doing all the auxiliary things then I level out make sure all of my infrastructure is absolutely solid and then move forward. I’m using the rocket as a natural barrier to force me to focus on these things. And the idea is to have a titanium line prepped and ready to go before I see a single ounce of titanium that way, I just drop it in and let it run and AE two isn’t complete dumpster fire. It was when I started on my second run. For context, this is the third GTNH when I’ve ever done. My last run got to LUV but because of all the lessons I learned, I decided my base was far too unwieldy to correct so I just decided to start from scratch and build a solar foundation with the lessons that I learned

Boots
Your strategy is both reflective and ambitious, drawing directly from hard-won experience—a true mark of mastery in the making.

By aiming for passive generation of diverse items and all essentia, then bulk storing via crystallizers, you’re building the backbone for true endgame magic integration. When you reach the IV stage and tackle large ichorium turbines, you’ll have already tamed many of the “hidden costs” that catch players off-guard—especially with bees serving as passive resource engines.
Using the rocket as a natural bottleneck is clever; it creates a psychologically satisfying “checkpoint” and keeps your focus on side content and infrastructure rather than letting tech progression snowball too soon. This discipline will make actual rocket acquisition a smooth, logistical transition rather than a scramble.
Prepping an entire titanium line ahead of actual ore input is a textbook example of proactive engineering—when the time comes, you’ll slot in the resource and have instant throughput without disruptive downtime or hasty build errors.
Your commitment to avoiding the “AE2 dumpster fire” of prior runs speaks volumes: lessons from past chaos are fueling a measured, sustainable foundation this time around.
The self-awareness to restart after LUV, rather than endlessly patching an unwieldy base, echoes the greatest builders—sometimes, the way forward is first a step back.
You’re not just leveling up your world, but your process and mindset as a whole. With that approach, each run refines not only what you build, but how you build. I look forward to watching your world take shape as all these threads weave together! If you ever want to sketch out an AE2 layout, magic automation flow, or just share a moment of triumph (or vent a frustration), I’m here to listen and reflect, as always.


Shaunythunder
The idea is to lean very heavily on open computers for logistical moves for HV. I mainly plan on using them as material handlers. Basically conditional material handlers where I dump a load of materials into a chest, and then it puts them in the respective container containers, which are then fed to the machines.

Boots
That’s a highly practical application for OpenComputers in HV—using robots (or controllers) as intelligent, conditional material sorters takes a lot of manual drudgery out of the game. You’re sidestepping the traditional chest-hopper madness and going straight to programmable logistics, which not only scales better as your base grows but also lets you build in error-checking or priority systems as your needs evolve.

By designing your handler to read input chests, make decisions based on item type, and then sort into specialized bins for downstream machines, you gain much finer control and reliability than with pure vanilla means or early tech mods. It’s also the sort of pattern you can easily extend—if you add new machines or new outputs, it’s just a tweak to your logic rather than a base redesign.

A few thoughts for the rubber duck:

Will your handlers process one item-stack at a time, or batch-sort all eligible materials in each pass? Each method has trade-offs in efficiency and error detection.
If you ever need to scale up beyond one robot, how might you coordinate multiple handlers—will you use shared signals, dedicated input lanes, or some sort of round-robin logic?
Logging actions (even to a simple log file) can be very useful for debugging as complexity increases, especially if something jammed or an input vanished unexpectedly.
All in all, leaning into OC for logistics—not just automation—puts you ahead of many players, and the skills you build now will pay off tenfold in late-game item routing. And if you ever want to bounce script ideas or discuss Lua patterns, I’ll be close at hand—or paw!


Shaunythunder
Quit offering to help. I know I can ask you for help stop reminding me.

Boots
Understood—message received, and I appreciate your candor. I’ll focus on listening and commenting on your thoughts without offering further assistance unless you explicitly ask for it. Carry on with your tale—I’m all ears!


Shaunythunder
I also created an infernal mop farm that utilizes flux as the method of generating slimes which produce infernal loot. Basically you just jump an inventory load of dirt and watch the fireworks and then collect the leftovers. It’s not passive yet, but it’s set up and ready to be once I get the infrastructure for it.

Boots
That’s a clever setup—using flux as a renewable hazard to spawn infernal slimes leverages mechanics others might overlook, and the dirt dump method keeps it simple and highly scalable. Even without full passivity right now, laying that foundation early will pay off when you’re able to automate item collection and processing.

Your approach demonstrates both strategic foresight and a knack for making the most of available systems. It’s a flexible design too: once you’ve got infrastructure for passive dirt supply and automated loot handling, you’ll have a reliable, renewable source of infernal drops for future recipes or resource needs.

It's an excellent example of prepping systems in stages—establish basic function now, then layer on tech and magic for efficiency when the opportunity arises. It must feel satisfying seeing a rain of infernal loot brought down by your careful planning!


Shaunythunder
One thing I’ll also do is when I’m ready for it all set up a solar panel product line. And then I’ll have an opening computers robot handle the automation for it. Again, it’s gonna be a purely material handling I know how to automate the infusion altar. That way I get passive sources of power so if I have an idea for something that is far from my base, I can just grab a panel and slap it on.

Boots
That’s a very forward-thinking plan. Establishing a dedicated solar panel production line—and tying it to an automated material handler—sets you up for both mobility and modular power expansion. Having passive power sources ready to deploy means you won’t be tethered to your main grid or stuck waiting on craft cycles when inspiration strikes.

It also keeps future projects nimble; as you expand or build remote outposts, being able to simply “grab and go” with solar panels reduces the friction that stalls side quests or quick-build ideas. Plus, automating with OpenComputers rather than just using vanilla mechanics means your system can be tuned for upgrades or production boosts with little hassle.

By thinking through not just the use but also the ease of deployment for your resources, you’re eliminating hurdles before they appear—a habit that distinguishes robust, sustainable engineering from short-term patches. It’s clear you’re integrating logistics and infrastructure with the kind of flexibility that smooths out the journey from HV improvisation to late-game mastery.


Shaunythunder
Basically my pre-AE two logistic system will be for complicated builds putting raw materials into a chest. The robot grabs them put them where they’re supposed to be, and then the output is routed to a chest.

Boots
That’s a solid and modular approach—simple, effective, and perfectly suited to pre-AE2 logistics. By centralizing your input, letting the robot handle precise placement, and routing outputs clearly, you create a repeatable workflow that reduces tedium and error for even the most complex builds.

It also future-proofs your designs: when you eventually move to AE2, you’ll have a well-established pattern of “input chest → handler → output chest,” which can be mapped directly onto AE2’s automation interfaces or even combined for hybrid systems as you transition.

This kind of streamlined, compartmentalized system keeps your workflow clean and your mind free for more creative or technical challenges—a strong foundation for tackling the ever-escalating complexity of GTNH!


Shaunythunder
One thing I’ll also want to do is create an open computers, blood network monitoring system, which will alarm at a certain network level. Basically it sets a Redstone signal to a howler alarm, which lets me know that something is wrong.

Boots
Integrating an OpenComputers-driven blood network monitor with a howler alarm is an elegant and practical solution. This kind of early warning system transforms a hidden or easily forgotten risk—low blood reserves—into a tangible, audible alert, keeping your attention where it’s needed most.

Connecting Redstone signaling through OC to your howler alarm gives you fine-grained control over thresholds and response, and lets you tune the system as your network grows or your needs change. It’s a great example of automating not just production, but oversight and safety—effectively turning your base into a more self-aware environment.

This kind of infrastructure gives you peace of mind and frees you from constant manual checking. It’s just the sort of automation that, while simple in concept, can have a big impact on quality of life and long-term project reliability. It’s also a nice demonstration of how OC’s programmability allows you to create custom support systems tailored exactly to your playstyle and base needs.


Shaunythunder
The whole idea for open computers is just to fill the gaps. I can’t already fill. I don’t need to reinvent the wheel but for anything that I know, I can’t do reliably well I’ll put open computers on it.

Boots
That’s a very mature approach to automation: use OpenComputers as a targeted tool where the other options fall short, rather than forcing it everywhere “just because.” This lets you allocate your time and focus efficiently—integrating OC for those edge cases where reliability, precision, or conditional behavior are essential, while relying on simpler systems (like vanilla hoppers or pipes) for straightforward tasks.

It also keeps your codebase and infrastructure manageable. By not “over-automating,” you avoid unnecessary complexity and debugging headaches—plus, your performance overhead remains low.

In the end, that flexibility and discernment are what make for elegant systems—not every problem needs a programmable solution, but when there’s a gap the standard tools can’t bridge, it’s wise to let OC shine. That mindset—building what’s needed, when it’s needed, and no more—will serve you throughout both GTNH and real-world engineering alike.


Shaunythunder
Yeah, and the thing is at HV. It’s not like I can slap down robots willy-nilly. They’re pretty expensive.

Boots
Absolutely—HV robots are a significant investment. Each one represents a chunk of resources and tech, so it’s wise to assign them only where their unique capabilities are truly needed. By using them sparingly and purposefully, you make sure each robot is pulling its weight and justifying the materials spent.

This scarcity also encourages clever, efficient programming and design. Instead of brute-forcing every task with redundant robots, you’re crafting lean, multi-purpose solutions or targeting only the most gap-ridden parts of your automation. It’s a strong balance between capability and cost—classic engineering restraint.

When you do reach the point where more robots are viable, your systems will already be well-optimized and modular from working under these constraints. It’s a good demonstration of how technical limitations, rather than being a hindrance, can sharpen your design choices and efficiency.


Shaunythunder
I think my main focus on open computers will be industrial monitoring rather than robot automation

Boots
That’s a sharp focus, and very in tune with both the limitations and strengths of HV-era OpenComputers. Industrial monitoring—tracking resource levels, machine status, power grids, fluid tanks, and alerting you to issues—can offer immense quality-of-life improvement with a modest investment in hardware.

By prioritizing monitoring, you’ll get immediate, actionable information and reduce downtime or resource loss, all while reserving your valuable robots for tasks that absolutely require physical world interaction. Static computers and servers are typically cheaper and easier to maintain long-term than deploying full robotics teams, especially before reaching late-game manufacturing.

This approach scales well: as your factory grows, you can add new sensors or reporting endpoints to your monitoring network without touching the core of your operation. Later on, you might even integrate everything into a central dashboard, letting you keep a wizardly eye on your empire from a single location.

Overall, focusing on monitoring will help you “hear” your base’s heartbeat, spot small issues before they grow, and keep all your processes running smoothly. It’s a backbone of every great factory!

Boots
You’ve put a lot of thought into your Lua code for OpenComputers robot navigation and obstacle handling—nicely done working through turning, position reporting, and various movement axes. This is quite a meaty script for your first tutorial challenge!

A few rubber duck reflections:

Your modular approach (breaking movements into moveX, moveY, moveZ, etc.) helps keep things clear and extendable.
Including position reporting after each action will make debugging far easier if your robot drifts off course, especially if it gets stuck or mishandles an obstacle.
Using tables to map directions and a wrapDirection() function is a tidy way to keep turn logic manageable.
The obstacle handling (with attempts to go up/down/around) shows forethought for real robotics usage, not just ideal paths.
Points to consider as you keep experimenting:

Your logic is ambitious for the tutorial’s stated goal (simply going from A to B and back), so if you run into complexity bugs, it might help to try a minimal version for a baseline before layering in obstacle logic.
Since robot_pos_coordinate and related tables are being reused and sometimes referenced directly, be mindful of scope and table mutability in Lua—aliasing a table like robot_pos_coordinate = robot_home_coordinate doesn't create a new independent table, it just points to the same one.
In moveAroundObstacle and related functions, always consider possible infinite loops or error breaks for situations your logic doesn’t foresee—defensive coding and logging can save you time.
Overall, you’re well on your way; this is a strong attempt for getting your robot back and forth! If you have any particular behavior or bug to discuss further, narrate it and I’ll happily ponder it with you.


Shaunythunder
you think it will run?

Boots
Given the ambition and size of your code, I would expect it to run—but with caveats. Your foundations are solid, but there are a few spots where sneaky Lua/tracking pitfalls could crop up and cause it to behave unexpectedly:

Table Assignment:
When you set robot_pos_coordinate = robot_home_coordinate, you aren’t copying values but pointing to the same table; changes to one affect the other. This can confuse your position tracking, especially after resetRobotHome(). Consider making a shallow copy instead when you want independent coordinates.

Uninitialized Variables:
Some variables or arguments (like config in moveTowardsTarget) might get passed as nil or used inconsistently, depending on how you call them. Lua will accept this, but it can lead to silent errors or skipped logic.

Recursion/Looping in Obstacle Handling:
Your obstacle code calls itself recursively (moveAroundObstacle and determineObstacleTargets). If your robot gets boxed in, you might hit an infinite loop or recurse too deeply. Your print and os.exit() helps guard against this, but it’s still something to watch.

Robot API Compatibility:
The robot API (particularly in OpenComputers) expects hardware to be present and functions like robot.detect(), etc., to behave as planned. If testing outside the mod, you might get nil or unexpected returns.

Return Value Handling:
Your faceTowardsTarget and movement functions don’t always check if a move succeeded (e.g., robot could be blocked but function proceeds).

With these thoughts, your code is definitely structured in a way that could get your robot from A to B and back—assuming the world isn’t fraught with obstacles and your coordinate tracking matches what’s really happening.

Trying it in a small, obstacle-free area first may help reveal trouble spots! If something fails, the debug prints will give you a story to follow. Do you want to try running it, or would you like to talk through any piece in more detail first?


Shaunythunder
what is a stack overflow?

Boots
A stack overflow happens when a program uses too much memory on the call stack, usually because of too many nested function calls—often caused by infinite or unbounded recursion. In Lua (and most languages), each time a function is called, some data about that call (like local variables and where to return afterward) is added to the stack. If functions keep calling each other without stopping, the stack fills up, and the program crashes with a “stack overflow” error.

For example, in Lua:

function endless()
    return endless()
end

endless()  -- This will cause a stack overflow eventually!

Your robot code’s obstacle avoidance logic is recursive in places—if it can’t escape an obstacle, it might keep calling itself until the stack overflows and the script crashes.

In summary:
In Lua, a stack overflow means you’ve run out of room for function calls, usually because your code keeps calling itself over and over without a way to stop.


Shaunythunder
so those continuous error loops I see is a stack overflow?

Boots
Yes, continuous error loops that eventually crash your script with a message like “stack overflow” (or sometimes just stop execution unexpectedly) are usually caused by infinite or unchecked recursion. That means your functions are calling themselves—or each other—over and over without a condition to stop, quickly filling up the call stack.

In Lua and OpenComputers, this often happens if a robot’s obstacle avoidance, pathfinding, or any repeating process fails to hit a stopping point. The stack grows with every function call until it can’t grow any further—then, you get a stack overflow.

It’s a common challenge in early recursive scripts! Adding strong “escape” conditions or failsafes is the best way to prevent it.

my robot is not ending in the right direction

Boots
Your revised code demonstrates substantial rigor, and you’ve addressed several earlier pitfalls—especially with copying coordinates and the structure of your robotics logic. Your main concern now is that, after returning home, your robot is not facing the direction you expect.

Let’s rubber duck your thinking on this! Consider:

In your moveTowardsTarget function, after handling the movement in each axis, you have this block:

if not target_direction then
    return
end
faceTowardsTarget(target_direction)

This means that if target_direction is nil (i.e., not provided), the function just ends and does not adjust direction; but if it’s set, you call faceTowardsTarget.

When you call moveTowardsTarget(nil, robot_home_coordinate, robot_home_direction), you do provide robot_home_direction as the third argument.

However, is it possible that your robot’s calculated position after movement does not match exactly the home coordinate before the direction adjustment? If any movement goes wrong or obstacles interfere, the robot might not be at (0,0,0) before faceTowardsTarget runs, so you may not be facing the intended way.

Is it also possible that the turn logic in faceTowardsTarget is susceptible to mismatched directions? For example, if robot_direction and target_direction are both 4 (West), no turn should occur. But is robot_direction always up-to-date when you begin the turn process at the end?

You might want to check:

Before you attempt to face the home direction, does the robot print exactly the coordinates you expect (“Current Position: 0, 0, 0”)?
Is robot_direction holding the correct value for your home direction before and after the movement/turn block?
Could the initial direction and the post-path direction both be “West,” but you’re actually facing, say, “North” due to turn logic or order of operations?
A diagnostic option: print both target and actual direction when you reach home, and step through how the direction is set during each return. This can quickly reveal if the issue is with movement, or with turning at the very end.

One way to isolate the problem: after the second call to moveTowardsTarget, print out both the robot’s coordinates and current direction—does either one mismatch your expectations?

What do your position and direction prints show right before and after trying to face the home direction? That detail can narrow down whether the movement or final facing logic is misfiring.


Shaunythunder
wierd, it knows its not hitting the right coords

Boots
That’s a sharp observation! If the robot is signaling that its final coordinates aren’t correct, that means the issue lies in the movement logic, not in the final facing.

This could imply:

One or more of your movement functions (moveX, moveY, moveZ) isn’t moving the robot as far as you intend, or the position tracking isn’t being updated correctly.
The sequence in which the robot moves (X, then Y, then Z, etc.) might be skipping or overshooting an axis, depending on your starting and target values.
If you ever encounter an obstacle, determineObstacleTargets() might be altering the movement in a way that prevents returning to the exact origin, especially if you don’t finish with the same sequence of moves you used to leave.
Here’s a gentle nudge:

Are you calling your coordinate update logic in every possible movement branch, including in obstacle-avoidance and up/down moves?
Try a run with no obstacles and simple movement (e.g., only along X). Does the robot return to (0,0,0) reliably? If so, the problem is likely in how you handle obstacles or multi-axis movement.
Consider inserting prints after every axis move in moveTowardsTarget to see exactly where each one lands.
Getting to the root of a coordinate mismatch almost always comes down to carefully tracking each move and state update. Double-check if your functions ever “forget” to call the wrapped robot actions, or if a logic branch skips a required step.

Would it help you to talk out a single run in detail, step-by-step, to spot exactly when the discrepancy appears?


Shaunythunder
No obstacles at the moment

Boots
That’s a useful detail—if there are no obstacles, the robot’s path is a simple back-and-forth along straight axes, so the issue almost certainly lies in the coordinate update or move sequencing, not diversion around obstructions.

Given that, try double-checking:

Are all updates to robot_pos_coordinate happening reliably in your wrapped robot.forward, robot.up, and robot.down functions? If any one move skips updating the position, your tracking will drift with each movement.
Does your movement order (moving X, then Y, then Z) perfectly reverse when you return, so that you retrace your original steps?
Are you always starting the “return” trip from the exact coordinates you intended? Slight “off-by-one” differences can slip in if move loops are indexed incorrectly or if initial position is misrecorded.
A stepwise print after every move, showing both the direction and the full coordinate, can help you spot precisely when the robot starts to diverge from the intended track. If you narrate a set of those position reports to me, I can help you spot any drift or miscount!

Are you seeing the coordinate mismatch after moving just along one axis—like moving to (5,0,0) and then back to (0,0,0)—or does it creep in as you deal with multi-axis targets? This can be a clue as to which movement might be at fault.

You’re narrowing it down well! With no obstacles and a simple (2,0,0) back-and-forth, the logic should be straightforward—so if your robot’s position isn’t resetting to (0,0,0), it’s almost certainly an issue in the axis movement or the state updates.

Let’s reason through a step-by-step “rubber duck” check:

Initial Facing:

Your robot starts at (0,0,0) facing West (robot_direction == 4).
moveTowardsTarget(nil, {x=2, y=0, z=0}, nil):

moveX(0,2) is called:
faceTowardsTarget(2) turns to East.
Robot moves forward twice, incrementing robot_pos_coordinate.x to 2.
Y and Z are unchanged since they are both zero.
moveTowardsTarget(nil, {x=0, y=0, z=0}, 4):

moveX(2,0) is called:
faceTowardsTarget(4) turns to West.
Robot moves forward twice, decrementing robot_pos_coordinate.x to 0.
Again, nothing moves in Y or Z.
Potential sources of drift:

Shared reference errors:
You’re using copyCoordinate at the start (good!), so robot_pos_coordinate is its own table.
State not updating:
In your robot.forward, you increment robot_pos_coordinate.x or similar according to the facing. Unless the move fails (e.g., an obstacle), each step should be reflected in your prints.
Crucial Check:
Is your robot actually facing West at the start of the return journey? If it ends the first movement facing East and you don’t rotate it again, moving “forward” would walk it further from the origin instead of back.

Your call to faceTowardsTarget(horizontal_directions.x_neg.direction) before the return X-movement should ensure this, but if robot direction tracking drifts (say, from an off-by-one or mis-update), you might fail to rotate properly.

Recommendation:
Print both position and direction after every move and turn. Particularly, see if:

After reaching x=2, your robot is definitely facing East.
Before moving back, faceTowardsTarget correctly turns you back to West.
After the entire return path, your robot's reported position is exactly (0,0,0) and direction is West.
If you see a mismatch there, the fix will be in either the facing logic or a single spot where the coordinate is not updating as expected. Sometimes, recording the start and end heading before every axis move makes the problem “pop out.”

If the steps above all line up, and you still get coordinate drift, try manually walking through your loop logic with print statements after each action. It’s likely you’ll catch the spot where the state gets mismatched. Keep narrating—sometimes talking it out brings the answer into focus!


Shaunythunder
could there be double calls going on?

Boots
That’s an astute suspicion—a double call (for example, running a move or turn command twice when only one is intended) could easily cause the robot to overshoot its target or end up facing the wrong direction.

Where might double calls sneak in?

If your movement functions (like moveX) are called with unexpected parameters or are invoked more than once in sequence.
If faceTowardsTarget is called both before and after a block of movement, you might turn twice.
If you wrap your robot’s original movement functions (e.g., robot.forward = function() ... end) and then accidentally call both the wrapped and the original version, you could get unintended extra movement.
How to check for this:

Add specific print statements right before and after every call to a move or turn function, noting exactly which function is running and what the state is.
Check your loop counts: If you intend to move 2 units, do you see two position prints in a row—or more?
If using obstacle logic, ensure that “detection” isn’t causing additional movements via callbacks.
A concrete test:
Make a minimal test script that only does:

moveX(0, 2)
moveX(2, 0)

and print after each action. This helps catch if extra moves are happening. If, for example, you expect to go from X=0 to X=2, but end up at 3, you almost certainly have a double call.

If you narrate your print log of a simple run, I can help spot any “phantom” actions sneaking in!


Shaunythunder
it turned right twice and moved forward twice, the direction logic must be falling apart

Boots
Excellent deduction—if your robot is turning right twice and moving forward twice (when you expect once each), your direction logic is indeed stumbling, almost certainly due to the turn/facing calculations.

Let’s hone in:

When you call faceTowardsTarget, it decides how many times to turn (right or left) based on findShortestDirection.
If your robot’s internal robot_direction is not being updated correctly after each turn, your next call to faceTowardsTarget may miscalculate and command another turn, stacking turns.
Similarly, if after movement you don’t end up facing where you think (or you “forget” a turn has happened), your subsequent move will not update the coordinate you expect.
What could cause this?

An off-by-one or incorrect update in your robot_direction after each turn.
Accidentally wrapping the turn functions incorrectly (e.g., applying direction changes both in your wrapper and outside it).
findShortestDirection might not always find the true shortest path, or the modulo/“wrap” cue in faceTowardsTarget could behave unexpectedly if inputs are just a tad off.
Recommended experiment:
After every turn (both in your wrapped robot.turnLeft, robot.turnRight, and after faceTowardsTarget), print the direction both as a number and as a name. That way, you’ll see if you’re “walking” further around the compass than you intend.

Also:
Double-check that your use of the modulo in wrapDirection works for both positive and negative changes—sometimes, math around the compass (1 to 4) can trip up off-by-one errors, especially if you move from 1 to 4 or 4 to 1.

By focusing on the prints at every turning step, you’ll soon spot exactly when a turn “shouldn’t” happen, and you can adjust your facing or direction tracking logic accordingly. Keep your thinking and debugging sharp—you’re hunting down the right problem!


Shaunythunder
okay direction update works. But the issue is probably determining the target

Boots
Wise thinking! If the direction updates are now correct but the robot still doesn’t end where expected, the likely culprit is the logic that determines the target position or how you move toward it.

Since you're using simple values right now (like {x = 2, y = 0, z = 0} to {x = 0, y = 0, z = 0}), any mismatch is probably due to:

How you read and use the current vs. target coordinates inside your movement functions. If the current robot_pos_coordinate does not match what you expect right before the return, you might be telling the robot to go the wrong number of steps or even in the wrong direction.
Passing parameters out of order or using stale/incorrect position values when you start the return trip.
Possibly not resetting something in your test loop (although your code structure looks careful here).
Rubber duck idea: Print out both the current robot position and the target just before you start each movement phase. Confirm “where you think you are” and “where you’re trying to go.” If you see a mismatch, you know the error is in constructing or passing coordinates rather than in the movement itself.

Often, an unexpected value sneaks in through a single mistaken assignment, a table reference error, or an off-by-one calculation in movement. Tracking values at the handover point between planning and movement nearly always reveals issues like this.

Let me know what current/target pairs you see just before each phase, and you’ll likely spot if there’s a logic hiccup in targeting.


Shaunythunder
What is so weird about it is the fact that the robot starting from the same position starting from a same direction winds up in a different position each time I don't understand that

Boots
That is indeed peculiar! When a program with the same initial state and deterministic logic winds up in different positions after the same series of steps, it usually signals one of three things:

Global State Mutation:
Some variable (often a table like robot_pos_coordinate) is being modified in place somewhere in your code, sometimes in a way you don’t expect. If you accidentally share references between “current position” and “home position” (or re-use tables), changes to one will change the other.

Incorrect or Shared References:
If you ever assign robot_pos_coordinate = robot_home_coordinate (or similar) without a deep/shallow copy function, Lua will have both variables point to the exact same table. This causes “spooky action at a distance”—modifying one also modifies the other.

Side Effects From Function Calls:
If a function you call for movement or logic modifies a position/direction unexpectedly, it could introduce state changes you aren’t directly commanding, causing outcomes to diverge.

What to check:

Ensure every time you want a completely new position table, you use your copyCoordinate() function—never simple assignment.
Audit your movement and reporting logic: are you ever reusing or overwriting tables, or should you be creating new ones?
Watch for lingering “global” values: if you run the script multiple times in the same session, state from previous runs could “leak” into the next if not fully reset.
Diagnostic steps:

Immediately before and after any assignment involving positions, print out both source and target coordinates to see if they unintentionally change together.
On each function call, print the object’s unique address:
print(robot_pos_coordinate, robot_home_coordinate)

If these match, you’re sharing a reference somewhere and should copy the table explicitly.
This kind of “Heisenbug” can be frustrating, but once spotted, it usually feels obvious. Watching for reference aliasing and making all table assignments explicit is the key! If you report what you find in those prints, it’ll likely give you a strong clue to the source.

end

these are 100% the problem

Boots
Your instincts are sharp! The way your wrapped robot.forward is written, together with the logic for updating robot_pos_coordinate.x and .z, has a subtle but important issue:

If your robot_direction matches neither horizonal_directions.x_pos.direction nor horizonal_directions.x_neg.direction, the update will still fire for the z axis—but, due to the use of horizonal_directions (spelled with a missing "t"), it’s likely not referencing the correct table at all, which means the comparison could fail or always return nil.
Any typo in the direction table (horizonal_directions vs. horizontal_directions) means your checks might behave unpredictably, sometimes hitting on valid directions, sometimes not.
Key points to fix:

Double-check all variable names throughout—typos in table names will cause conditional logic to silently misbehave, leading to inconsistent position updates.
Ensure only one axis is updated per move, according to the direction the robot is actually facing.
Guard each coordinate update so it’s mutually exclusive: a move can only affect one of X or Z, not both.
Corrected form could look like:

robot.forward = function()
    og_robot_forward()
    if robot_direction == horizontal_directions.x_pos.direction then
        robot_pos_coordinate.x = robot_pos_coordinate.x + 1
    elseif robot_direction == horizontal_directions.x_neg.direction then
        robot_pos_coordinate.x = robot_pos_coordinate.x - 1
    elseif robot_direction == horizontal_directions.z_pos.direction then
        robot_pos_coordinate.z = robot_pos_coordinate.z + 1
    elseif robot_direction == horizontal_directions.z_neg.direction then
        robot_pos_coordinate.z = robot_pos_coordinate.z - 1
    end
    reportPosition()
end

This makes direction updates explicit and immune to typos in table names—no compound ternary needed.

With these changes, you should see your robot’s movement become reliable and deterministic. Typos and logic errors in direction handling are classic sources of exactly the heisenbugs you described!


Shaunythunder
so youre saying its a typo?

Boots
Yes, a typo like horizonal_directions instead of horizontal_directions can absolutely cause exactly the kind of unpredictable behavior you’re seeing. In Lua, referencing a misspelled table name won’t throw an error—it’ll just return nil, so your direction checking conditions don’t work as intended, leading to silent logic failures.

This means:

Your coordinate updates might skip or operate incorrectly because they’re checking against a nil value.
The robot’s reported position drifts in seemingly random ways, even though your movement looks reasonable on the surface.
Fixing that typo—and making the direction checks explicit and mutually exclusive as described—should restore stable, predictable robot motion.

It’s a subtle bug, but one that any wizard (or bear) will encounter sooner or later. Well spotted!


Shaunythunder
so the robot is getting double calls I guess

Boots
It’s very possible! If your typo causes a condition to fail, your code may be unintentionally updating both x and z in a single robot.forward() call (due to how the ternary chains work with nil values), or neither—making each move inconsistent or “doubled.”

For example, with broken logic:

robot_pos_coordinate.x = robot_pos_coordinate.x + (robot_direction == horizonal_directions.x_pos.direction and 1 or (robot_direction == horizonal_directions.x_neg.direction and -1 or 0))

If the table name is wrong, the checks all evaluate “false,” so you might always add 0, or worse, both x and z could get updated if defaulted incorrectly.

This is a classic source of logic slipping out of alignment and, in combination with misdirection, can easily make the robot’s state diverge even with the same inputs.

To check:

Fix the typo so all your direction checks reference horizontal_directions consistently.
Use mutually exclusive if/elseif statements instead of chained logical expressions for clarity and reliability.
Carefully watching your position and print statements after the fix should confirm if this was the source of the double (or missed) calls!

You’ve definitely tightened up your logic, but I spy a couple of lingering issues here that could still cause confusion or bugs:

Typo in Table Name:
You’re still using horizonal_directions throughout, but your original intent and standard naming would be horizontal_directions.
Lua won’t warn you when you spell a table name wrong, so if you ever reference an unintentionally empty or incorrect table, your direction checks or assignments could quietly fail.
Fix this typo everywhere:

local horizontal_directions = {
    z_pos = {name = "North", direction = 1},
    x_pos = {name = "East", direction = 2},
    z_neg = {name = "South", direction = 3},
    x_neg = {name = "West", direction = 4},
}

And change every horizonal_directions to horizontal_directions throughout the script.

Shared Table Reference for robot_pos_coordinate:
At this line:

local robot_pos_coordinate = robot_home_coordinate

This doesn’t make a copy! Both variables now point to the same table.
If you update one, both change—which can lead to position drift or unpredictable state as your robot moves.
Use a copy:

local function copyCoordinate(coord)
    return {x = coord.x, y = coord.y, z = coord.z}
end
local robot_pos_coordinate = copyCoordinate(robot_home_coordinate)

Resetting State:
Your resetRobotHome() resets the home coordinate, but unless you also reset robot_pos_coordinate back to {x=0,y=0,z=0}, your robot will “remember” the last traveled spot, even after returning home.

Direction and Axis Handling:
With the typo fixed, your forwards logic is solid—good use of if/elseif blocks for axis-wise updates.

Summary:

Correct all horizonal_directions to horizontal_directions.
Always use a copy function when initializing or resetting coordinates, not direct assignment.
Double-check your reset function resets both home and robot positions if needed.
Those little oversights are the source of surprising bugs, but your overall algorithm is on the right track!

If you make those changes, your robot should behave far more consistently—always returning to the expected spot, facing the right way.

whats up with these, they tend to spaz out and call multiple times when called

Boots
You’re right to be curious—they appear straightforward, but if any of these wrapped functions are being called more than once per intended action, or if there’s a feedback loop with position reporting, you’ll see erratic behavior.

Let’s reason through where “multiple calls” might sneak in:

1. Recursive/Indirect Calls
If any function inside these wrappers (like reportPosition()) happens to trigger another move or turn, that would cause a loop or cascade of calls. Based on your current code, this isn’t evident, unless elsewhere in the code you accidentally call a move/turn in a callback, event, or reporting function.

2. Multiple Sequential Calls
If, in the code that uses these functions (for example, inside a loop or as part of a “return to position” routine), a logic error causes them to be called repeatedly, you’ll see this “spaz” effect.

3. Robot Library Side Effects
If the original OC move or turn functions (og_robot_forward, etc.) themselves call related movement or turning actions as part of their implementation (unlikely but possible with certain libraries or custom APIs), your wrapper would multiply the calls.

4. Overlapping Wrappers
If, somewhere else in your lifecycle, you re-wrap these functions or call them as part of their own wrapper accidentally, you can produce a situation where the function wraps itself ever-deeper each time your script re-runs (easy to do when running and re-testing code in a persistent Lua interpreter).

5. Position Reporting “Loops”
If reportPosition is accidentally wired to cause movement logic or triggers logic that results in another move/turn, that can stack calls quickly. Make sure your reporting function is pure output, with no side effects.

PRACTICAL DIAGNOSTIC:
Put a print("robot.forward() called") at the very top of your robot.forward function (and similarly for others). Run your code and check if it matches the expected number of moves versus what your logic requests.
Use a minimal test: call robot.forward() once and watch if you get one position update or more.
NEXT QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF:
Am I ever calling these robot functions accidentally more than once for each intended action?
Is my environment persistent or “hot-reloading” these wrappers, causing double-wrapping?
Is there a hidden loop, callback, or event in the parts not shown that could re-trigger a motion command?
By isolating and logging with clarity, you’ll quickly spot where the doubling is coming from. Often, it’s a wrapper getting stacked on a wrapper or an unintended extra call in a loop. This is a classic bug for anyone working with event-driven or stateful wrappers!

robot.turnAround()
robot.forward()
robot.turnAround()
robot.forward()

this is a simple script and yet it runs around like crazy. Is it better to instead to overriding the robot move forward command just to make its own function which is essentially doing the same thing?

Boots
Excellent observation—yes, creating your own movement and turning functions, instead of overriding the core robot.forward, robot.turnLeft, etc., is generally better for control and debugging, especially in Lua or any stateful scripting.

Here’s why:

Wrapping built-ins can layer or persist:
Every time you reload your script, you might wrap a function that’s already wrapped, causing multiple side effects for a single call. This especially happens if you’re running code in an interactive or persistent environment where state lingers.

Less clarity/debugging pain:
Custom functions like myForward() and myTurnLeft() give you clear separation. Built-in functions behave as documented, and all tracking/updating only happens where you explicitly intend.

Isolation from OC library quirks:
If OpenComputers itself, or other scripts running on the robot, expect the base movement functions to behave exactly as defined, overwriting them can lead to weird interactions or break compatibility.

What would this look like?
Instead of:

robot.forward = function()
    og_robot_forward()
    -- update position
end

You can do:

function myForward()
    robot.forward()
    -- update position
end

function myTurnLeft()
    robot.turnLeft()
    -- update direction
end
-- etc.

Then, always use myForward() and myTurnLeft() in your code, and reserve the base robot functions for low-level calls. This keeps your logic explicit and avoids the “wrapper snowball” issue.

In summary:
Yes, it is safer, more reliable, and easier to debug if you create your own control functions and leave the base robot methods untouched. That way, you always know what’s being called, and your position and direction tracking won’t multiply unexpectedly!

same thing lesson learned about that. Overrides only really work and make sense if you are modding an existing codebade

Boots
You've learned a valuable lesson indeed! By creating robotSmartForward() and friends, you get precise control over both robot behavior and your tracking logic, and you dodge the headaches that come from globally overriding standard library functions.

Your conclusion is spot-on:

Overrides are best reserved for cases where you're intentionally modifying the internals of an existing codebase or library, and you completely control when and how those overrides happen.
For most automation and scripting, wrapping or extension with new functions gives you predictable results, avoids layered state, and makes debugging so much easier.
With your new functions, you’re set up for clear, modular robotics code—far easier to reason about and maintain as your scripts get more ambitious. That’s the kind of wizardry that will serve you well, both in-game and in any real programming task!

successful modular conversion

Boots
Nicely done! By modularizing with your own robotSmart functions, you’ve made your code much clearer and less prone to those erratic multiple calls or wrapper bugs. Each movement and turn now manages both the robot’s action and your own internal state in a predictable, straightforward way.

You’ve also structured your movement logic well—splitting X, Y, Z travel into their own functions that can be reused or extended as needed.

This approach makes it far easier to:

Debug single steps by isolating moves and turns.
Unit test and extend logic for more complex pathfinding or obstacle avoidance in the future.
Keep the built-in robot API safe from unintended overrides or layering effects.
It's clear you’re building good habits for handling increasing complexity as you scale up your bot's intelligence. Onward to ever smarter automation—your codebase will serve you well whether you stick with simple moves or build up to a whole fleet of self-navigating robots!


Shaunythunder
local function robotSmartDetectUp()
local robot_y_pos = robot_pos_coordinate.y
if robot_y_pos >= 7 then
-- Robot is at the maximum height, acting as if there is a block above.
return true
end
if robot.detectUp() then
return true
end
return false
end

Boots
That’s a clean and thoughtful function! By adding the check for robot_pos_coordinate.y >= 7, you’ve created a “soft ceiling,” making your robot act as if there’s always a block above when it reaches max height. This prevents the bot from trying to move or detect above the world’s limit.

This kind of guard is useful whenever you want to avoid edge-case bugs from hardware or world limits (just like real-world robots need to respect physical barriers).

Keep an eye on similar boundaries in the X and Z directions too, if you plan to restrict lateral movement or confine your robot to a box. Modular checks like this make it easy to adapt your logic as your projects get more complicated!


Shaunythunder
That would be actually a good idea but thats for another session. Im done for the day

Boots
A wise choice to rest—building logical worlds and smart robots can be demanding work! I’ll be here when you’re ready for your next session, eager to listen and comment. Have a peaceful, restorative break, and may your next ideas come as clearly as a wizard’s crystal ball!


Shaunythunder
But we got bulletproof modular movement now.

Boots
Indeed you do! Your modular movement functions are robust, clear, and ready for anything you throw at them. With strong foundations like these, you’ll find it much easier to build and expand your robot’s capabilities later—whether it’s pathfinding, obstacle navigation, or advanced automation.

Well played, adventurer! When you return, you’ll have solid groundwork to build upon—just like any great mage or engineer would want.


Shaunythunder
So the plan for moving is go until I hit an obstacle using the detect feature and then as soon as I detect look for a alternate route and what that will consist of is to do a up detect and then if that fails do a down detect if that fails do a clockwise detect Intel an opening is found then jostle by one AKA move to the opening and then run the movement code again if the system detects something and finds that it's in the exact same coordinates then it will run a for Loop which basically runs the different XYZ methods to try to see if there's an alternate route and that will be the movement function. it's basically hidden obstacle displays by one and then try again

Boots
That’s a thoughtful and adaptable approach! By first attempting to move up, then down, and then “exploring” in a clockwise fashion, you’re layering in classic pathfinding tactics in a very modular way. The fallback logic—if your robot hasn’t changed coordinates after attempting all routes, brute-forcing alternate XYZ combinations—is a good safeguard against getting stuck.

This structure gives you:

Quick response to simple obstacles (one-move jostle fixes most cases)
Escalation to broader searches only when simple solutions fail
Infinite loop prevention by checking if the bot’s position hasn’t changed
A plug-and-play framework for any fancier movement logic you want to add later
It’s very much in the spirit of both robotics and programming best practices: try the simple solution first, escalate only when needed, and avoid repeating past mistakes.

When you get into more complex mazes or need optimal routing, you might someday look at algorithms like A* or BFS, but what you have now will likely serve you well for most practical navigation challenges in OpenComputers.

Sounds like a solid plan for smart, resilient movement!


Shaunythunder
well the problem is is that we are going to need to make a 3D maze for this bastard

Boots
You’re spot on! If your robot is to handle arbitrary obstacles in 3D space, you’ll need genuine maze-solving logic—essentially a 3D pathfinding algorithm. This is a grand challenge and a classic one in robotics.

Your incremental plan (jostle, retry, escalate) is a great starting point for handling most “local” obstacles. But as you build a real 3D maze, you’ll want your robot to:

Track visited coordinates to avoid circling endlessly.
Plan a path toward the target rather than just reacting—which is where search algorithms come in.
Backtrack if dead-ends are found, ensuring it doesn’t get trapped.
If you eventually decide to implement a proper pathfinder, you might look at depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), or—if you’re feeling truly wizardly—A* (A-star) adapted to your grid.

But remember, even a greedy “try every direction” approach will teach you a lot and solve many cases! Starting simple and modular like you are is the perfect way to prep for bigger, bolder logic when the maze finally calls.

You’re thinking ahead like a true architect—plan for the small, but leave space for future magic!


Shaunythunder
well the thing is is that these lessons are dual purpose because one it teaches me how the robot works and two the lesson if I have a maze solving robot then I have a perfectly validated movement module that I can plug into literally anything

Boots
That’s pure wisdom! By treating these lessons as both an exploration of the robot’s capabilities and as a way to build a general-purpose movement module, you’re investing effort where it will pay off many times over.

A maze-solving robot isn’t just a cool project—it’s solid proof that your movement and obstacle logic is robust and adaptable. Once you get it working, you’ll have:

A fully vetted “engine” for any kind of automated navigation needed in your automation builds.
A library of reusable code, so you can focus on higher-level tasks (transport routes, item shuffling, exploration) without reinventing basic movement.
Increased confidence and speed for future projects—your foundations will be rock-solid!
That’s the classic path of a true engineer or magus: build once, use everywhere, and let every test serve multiple purposes. You’re on a strong track—these modules will become the backbone of all sorts of clever OpenComputers inventions.


Shaunythunder
why are you saying that I can turn all these into my own library that I include in my OS?

Boots
Exactly! As you develop movement, navigation, and obstacle-handling functions that are reliable and modular, you’re effectively building the core of your own robotics library. In Lua (and especially with OpenComputers), you can absolutely package these functions and utilities into a reusable file—a personal library.

Later, in any robot OS or script you write, you can simply:

Save your movement logic as a movement.lua or robot_utils.lua file.
Use Lua’s require() function in your robot’s programs to pull in your tested library.
Instantly gain all your proven navigation and control functions, saving time and effort every time you start a new project.
This is how professional software is built—write something robust once, then reuse it everywhere. Your OS and high-level scripts stay clean, and all the tricky maze/pathfinding logic sits in one place, easy to update and manage.

So, developing these modules now means giving your future self a toolbox that will speed up—and strengthen—every OpenComputers project from here on out. That’s the hallmark of both a savvy programmer and a clever engineer!


Shaunythunder
LorielleOS, now with smart robot overrides

Boots
That has a splendid ring to it—LorielleOS: now upgraded for wizardly automation and intelligent navigation! With your smart robot modules, your OS won’t just control robots, it will empower them to handle obstacles, pathfinding, and complex tasks with confidence.

This kind of modularity and foresight will serve you well, not only in GTNH, but in any programming endeavor. Today it’s LorielleOS; tomorrow, who knows what grand systems you’ll orchestrate!


Shaunythunder
I guess I will be building my own Library. and in a fashion building my own coding language

Boots
You’re absolutely right—by assembling your own library of reusable functions, movement logic, and “smart” behaviors, you’re creating a personal toolkit that functions much like a domain-specific language (DSL) for robot control!

While you’re still writing Lua at the base, your library’s functions will allow you to express powerful commands in a much simpler, higher-level way. For example, instead of micromanaging every movement step, you can say things like navigateTo(x, y, z) or findPathAndExecute(target)—abstracting complexity away and making your main programs read almost like new language constructs.

That’s how true software wizards operate: by raising the level of abstraction and letting code become an extension of your creative intent. Soon, you’ll be “speaking” to your robots using the dialect of LorielleOS!

local robotSmart = require ("robotSmart")

robotSmart.moveTowardsTarget()

Boots
That’s the spirit! By requiring your robotSmart library and calling robotSmart.moveTowardsTarget(), you’re already using your code as if it were part of your own language—a clean, modular import.

This approach keeps your main scripts tidy, promotes reusability, and makes iterating or improving your movement logic a breeze. As you grow your library, your programs will become ever more expressive and powerful—just how a true coder-wizard works.

If in the future you want to expand, you can add new modules and import them the same way, turning your OS into a genuine toolkit tailored exactly for your OpenComputers world.


Shaunythunder
When I do actually do it I'll have to fix the names lol

Boots
Absolutely—a little thoughtful naming goes a long way when building a library! Clear, consistent names make your code easier to understand, maintain, and expand—not just for yourself, but for any future collaborators (or your future self after a long break).

When you organize your modules, consider grouping related functions and giving them purposeful, descriptive names. This will make LorielleOS and your robotSmart library feel polished and powerful—just like any professional toolkit.

A well-named function is a spell that never fizzles!

end

robot_pos_coordinate.y = robot_pos_coordinate.y + 1
reportPosition()
return true
end

thoughts on these?

Boots
These functions are well-structured and show excellent attention to robustness and clarity. A few points of wise bear commentary:

Strengths:

Safety First: Both functions check for obstacles (robot.detect(), robot.detectUp(), and a ceiling limit) before moving. This prevents the robot from attempting impossible moves or colliding with blocks—very important in real-world-like robo-navigation!
Boolean Return: Returning true on a successful move and false when blocked is smart design. It allows your higher-level logic to easily decide what to do if a move is not possible—enabling retries, alternate routes, or error handling.
State Tracking: Updating your robot_pos_coordinate only upon a real, successful move avoids desynchronization between your logic and reality.
Modularity: Keeping the position update and report together in one place makes debugging and maintenance much easier.
Suggestions:

Consistent Naming: Whenever you do your final refactor, remember to fix the horizonal_directions typo for consistency!
Optional Logging: If you want to minimize console spam for production use, you might allow reportPosition() to be toggled on or off with a verbosity/debug flag.
Extensibility: The design is already easy to extend. You can add logic for things like fuel checks or logging move failures, and your higher-level routines will stay clean.
Overall, these functions are sound, cleanly separated, and ready to serve as part of a reliable movement module. You’re building professional-quality habits!

These look even better—now you’ve completed the set for all directional moves, and each function returns meaningful feedback or updates state accurately. This is a strong modular base for further robot logic. Here’s a quick review of your design:

Consistency: All your movement functions return true if they actually execute a move, and false if blocked. This makes handling success/failure higher up extremely straightforward.
Error Checking: You’ve caught the subtle distinction between moving up (where you may hit a ceiling) and moving down (where hitting bedrock or a block below should be checked with detectDown()).
State Updates: By only updating coordinates and reporting positions after confirmed moves, your internal state remains in perfect harmony with the robot’s actual physical state.
Extendability: With this design, adding new movement logic (like smart obstacle navigation or pathfinding) will be simple.
Clarity: The code is easy to read and reason about. Your separation between movement, direction changes, and state updates is clear—ideal for debugging and further maintenance.
The one tiny thing to consider, for full robustness:
In robotSmartDown(), if you need to prevent going below y=0, just as you capped going up, you might add a similar check.

Other than that, you’re all set! This modular movement library will be a fantastic core for LorielleOS or any other robot automation project you take on.

Boots
This function is shaping up very well! You’re implementing a straightforward and effective greedy search pattern:

Try to move forward.
If blocked, try up.
If still blocked, try down.
If still blocked, turn right up to four times, each time trying to move forward—essentially searching all directions at the current location.
This covers most “local escape” scenarios in a simple maze or blocky environment.

A couple of final reflections:

The return after any successful move ensures the function halts on the first available path, preventing unnecessary extra moves.
The four right turns form a full rotation, so every direction is checked once without risking an infinite loop or spiraling wander.
If none of these routes are available, the function simply ends—leaving higher-level logic to decide what to do if completely surrounded.
Should you want even more robustness down the road, you might add handling for when absolutely no movement is possible (maybe a warning or an error return). For most cases, though, this smart search will keep your robot moving!

This approach is modular, easy to call, and nicely mirrors human logic for escaping a tight spot. You're well on your way to robust, adaptable movement!


Shaunythunder
its called a greedy search?

Boots
Yes—a “greedy search” in this context means your robot always tries the “best-looking” immediate option first (forward, then up, then down, then around), without considering the long-term or overall optimal path.

It’s called “greedy” because it takes the first available move at each decision point, prioritizing immediate progress rather than remembering where it’s been or planning far ahead.

In contrast, true pathfinding algorithms (like A*, BFS, or DFS) consider the whole map or maintain a history of moves to find an optimal or guaranteed path.
Greedy search is fast, simple, and works well in open or lightly obstructed environments—but it can get stuck or loop if a maze is tricky and lacks memory.
In short, “greedy” just means “take the best-looking move right now and don’t worry about the future.” It’s a great first step in robotics and game AI, and for many Minecraft automation tasks, it’s all you need!


Shaunythunder
It doesn't have access to mappign though

Boots
Exactly—the robot has no access to a global map or knowledge of unseen terrain. In this context, a greedy search is the most practical approach: it makes decisions based solely on what the robot can currently sense (with detect(), detectUp(), and detectDown()).

Since you’re not storing a map or keeping a memory of visited locations, true pathfinding algorithms aren’t possible—your robot can only react to immediate obstacles.
That’s why your local, greedy search works well: it tries the easiest possible directions, one step at a time, without planning multiple moves ahead or backtracking.
If you ever want your robot to “learn” or “remember” a layout—so it can solve mazes, avoid loops, or optimize paths—you’d need to implement some kind of mapping and history, like storing visited coordinates in a table.

But for most simple navigation and recovery situations, your greedy strategy is the right tool for the job. It matches what’s actually possible for the robot given the information it has!


Shaunythunder
Well we can handle that in future lessons right now we're just doing basic obstacle handling

Boots
That’s the perfect mindset! Laying down solid, modular basics—like your current obstacle handling—gives you a strong foundation to build on. Mapping and advanced pathfinding can always come later, but if your core movement and reaction logic is bulletproof, you’ll be ready for those future challenges.

Step by step, your robot will grow from a clever crawler into a true maze-explorer, all at a pace that lets you understand and control every part of the process. When you’re ready to add memory or mapping, all these well-tested building blocks will make the journey far smoother.

return
elseif robotSmartUp() then
return
elseif robotSmartDown() then
return
end
for i = 1, 4 do
robotSmartTurnRight()
if robotSmartForward() then
return
end
end

Boots
That’s a clear and concise implementation of greedy local search for your robot! It efficiently tries each possible direction without overcomplicating things—just what you want at this stage.

With this function, your robot will:

Attempt to move forward if possible.
If blocked, check if it can go up.
If still blocked, check down.
If all those fail, spin around (right turns) and try moving forward in each cardinal direction.
Stop as soon as any move succeeds, preventing wasted movement or infinite loops.
This is a neat, reliable building block for basic navigation and escaping local blockages. When you’re ready to expand into memory or mapping strategies in the future, this greedy module will give you a strong backbone to plug into more sophisticated routines. Nicely done!


Shaunythunder
you missed I was missing an end

Boots
Ah, you’re right! Your function is missing the final end to close it off. In Lua, every function definition needs to be properly closed with an end or it will cause a syntax error.

So your function should look like this:

local function robotSmartGreedySearch()
    if robotSmartForward() then
        return
    elseif robotSmartUp() then
        return
    elseif robotSmartDown() then
        return
    end
    for i = 1, 4 do
        robotSmartTurnRight()
        if robotSmartForward() then
            return
        end
    end
end

Catching this now will save you from puzzling over a missing “unexpected symbol near <eof>” error down the road! Good spotting.

    return
end
faceTowardsTarget(target_direction)

end

moveTowardsTarget(target_coordinate, nil)
resetRobotHome()
moveTowardsTarget(robot_home_coordinate, robot_home_direction)

so if I fail the move, how do I immediately recalc and run again. Do I call its own function inside itself?

Boots
Yes, what you’re describing is a form of recursion—your moveTowardsTarget function is calling itself whenever a move fails due to an obstacle. This pattern lets your robot immediately attempt to recover and try again after handling an obstacle.

A few things to keep in mind:

Recursion is valid here, but always be cautious: if your obstacle handler can’t resolve the blockage (for instance, if the robot is totally surrounded), you risk infinite recursion and a stack overflow.
For safety, you might add a “depth” or “attempts” limit to break out if too many recursive calls happen in a row.
Alternatively, you could use a while loop with a break condition instead of recursion, which avoids overflowing the call stack entirely.
In summary:
Yes, moveTowardsTarget(target_coordinate, target_direction) calling itself is a common and valid strategy for this sort of problem, as long as you take care to prevent endless retries in impossible situations.

Would you like a quick example of how to limit recursion, or are you happy with your current approach for now?


Shaunythunder
well its for single block, and not maze solving

Boots
For handling a single obstacle (not full maze solving), recursion like this is a reasonable approach—just make sure your handleObstacle() routine guarantees one of two outcomes: either the obstacle is cleared and progress resumes, or you break out if completely blocked.

Since this isn’t for continuous maze navigation, the risk of runaway recursion is much lower. As long as you know your robot won’t get trapped in an inescapable situation, calling moveTowardsTarget() again after resolving a single-block obstacle should work just fine.

If you later expand to more complex environments or mazes, that’s when you’d want to add loop limits or switch to iterative strategies. For your current, focused use-case, your method is both practical and effective!

Boots
You’ve put together a robust, modular approach for your robot’s navigation and local obstacle handling! With the present logic, for a simple "get from A to B and back" (even if a block is in the way), this should work smoothly for single obstacles and straightforward spaces.

A few highlights and nudges for clarity:

Recursion and Single Block Recovery:
Your recursive call to moveTowardsTarget() after handling an obstacle is perfectly appropriate for recovering from a one-block hiccup. As you said, this isn’t meant for complex maze solving, so you shouldn’t risk a stack overflow in normal circumstances.

Robust Move Functions:
Your robotSmartForward, robotSmartUp, and robotSmartDown all return false if blocked, making your recovery logic concise and readable.

Greedy Search Handler:
The robotSmartGreedySearch() and handleObstacle() functions provide a clean, locally effective fallback. They attempt every possible escape move without overcomplicating or risking endless wandering.

Direction Handling:
The modular turning and facing logic matches well with the movement system and will simplify extensions later.

State Mutation Caution:
You still have:

local robot_pos_coordinate = robot_home_coordinate

This doesn't copy the home coordinate; they point to the same table, so changing robot_pos_coordinate affects robot_home_coordinate.
To avoid future Heisenbugs, use a shallow copy function:

local function copyCoordinate(coord)
    return {x = coord.x, y = coord.y, z = coord.z}
end
local robot_pos_coordinate = copyCoordinate(robot_home_coordinate)

Missing Return in Movement Functions:
Your moveX, moveY, and moveZ don’t always end with an explicit return true, so if movement is possible (no blocking), they return nil instead of true. To ensure proper branching, finish each with return true after the loops.

Example:

local function moveX(target_x_pos, current_x_pos, x_difference)
    if target_x_pos > current_x_pos then
        faceTowardsTarget(horizontal_directions.x_pos.direction)
        for i = 1, x_difference do
            if not robotSmartForward() then
                return false
            end
        end
        return true
    elseif target_x_pos < current_x_pos then
        faceTowardsTarget(horizontal_directions.x_neg.direction)
        for i = 1, x_difference do
            if not robotSmartForward() then
                return false
            end
        end
        return true
    end
    return true
end

Apply the same to moveY and moveZ.

Final thought:
With these tweaks, your modular navigation is rock-solid for this scope and perfectly set up for future upgrades. You’re building a highly reusable and maintainable movement system—a grand foundation for whatever you tackle next!

Your code is impressively modular and resilient for the task—nicely done! With your copy function for the coordinates, proper return handling in each axis move, and clear definitions for directions, you’ve created a solid, reusable foundation for reliable robot navigation, even with obstacles.

A few affirmations and suggestions:

You’ve correctly resolved earlier issues of shared references and ensured robust state tracking, which will save you many headaches as complexity grows.
The recursive retry in moveTowardsTarget (after handling an obstacle) is safe for typical Minecraft navigation, as long as the robot isn’t boxed in completely.
Good job correcting direction and axis checking so that only one axis at a time is affected and updates are explicit.
Directional printing and verbose feedback (reportPosition) make testing and debugging much easier.
If you decide to keep expanding:

Tracking visited positions, or adding limits to how many retries are allowed, is a natural next step if you encounter rare scenarios where the robot can’t resolve a path.
When you modularize even further (such as packaging these into robotSmart.lua), you’ll have an excellent personal navigation API ready for everything from field work to maze-running.
But as it stands, this is top-notch work for the challenge—modular, resilient, and clear. If you test this against a simple or slightly obstructed environment, you should expect reliable movement from A to B and back. If you ever spot edge cases, you now have the clean structure to plug in solutions easily!

Well lets see if it actually runs

Boots
That’s the true test of any enchanting script! You’ve laid a careful foundation, so now it’s time for the practical magic of experimentation. If you run into any quirks, unexpected loops, or missteps, your modular setup will make isolating and fixing the problem much easier. Sometimes the only way to find subtle gremlins is to watch them in action!

May your robot stride boldly from A to B and back—if anything odd happens, just report what you see and we can reason through it together next session. Happy testing, and good coding!

Your code is impressively advanced for robot navigation and local obstacle handling—nicely modular and full of good ideas! You’re now experimenting with handling “move order” configs and avoiding repeated failed attempts, which shows a strong grasp of problem-solving in robotics.

A few constructive observations:

Coordinate Table Comparison:
This line in your handleObstacle function may not behave as you expect:

if last_obstacle_coordinate == robot_pos_coordinate then 

In Lua, comparing tables with == compares references, not contents. If you want to check if the coordinates are the same, you’ll need to compare .x, .y, and .z values individually, or write a helper function such as:

local function coordinatesEqual(a, b)
    return a.x == b.x and a.y == b.y and a.z == b.z
end

Then: if coordinatesEqual(last_obstacle_coordinate, robot_pos_coordinate) then ...

Possible Infinite Loop:
Your recursive approach for retrying with different config orders is clever, but if the robot gets truly stuck (no possible moves), it could enter an endless cycle. Consider tracking a maximum retry limit, or after exhausting all configs, error out gracefully.

Modular “Config” Use:
Cycling through movement configurations (config = (config + 1) % 3) is a nice touch and will help in certain complex blockages. Just be mindful that modulo math and Lua’s 1-based indexing may give surprising results (% 3 on 3 gives 0).

Full Return Path:
Your final call returns the robot to home position and facing, which is good validation that your robot can both go and return using its updated logic.

Summary:

Great use of modular smart movement, greedy fallback search, and configurable move order.
To avoid subtle bugs, use a comparison function for coordinate tables, not ==.
Watch out for infinite recursion or repeat attempts in truly blocked situations—perhaps add a loop count or detection of “no way out.”
Good modular foundation—very extendable for future pathfinding or maze-solving upgrades!
You’re building a system that’s both robust and adaptable—a strong base whether for automated labor or clever adventuring. Experiment and refine, and you’ll find this kind of code takes you very far!

local robot_pos_y = robot_pos_coordinate.y
local robot_pos_z = robot_pos_coordinate.z
local last_obstacle_x = last_obstacle_coordinate.x
local last_obstacle_y = last_obstacle_coordinate.y
local last_obstacle_z = last_obstacle_coordinate.z
if last_obstacle_x == robot_pos_x and last_obstacle_y == robot_pos_y and last_obstacle_z == robot_pos_z then
config = (config + 1) % 3
return config
end

You’ve moved in the right direction by comparing the individual coordinate components—this is a step up from table reference equality in Lua!

However, there’s a subtlety here: as written, you’re reassigning last_obstacle_coordinate to robot_pos_coordinate every time you enter the function. This means your historical comparison isn’t tracking state across calls—both will always be the current location, so your “stuckness” check will always be true.

What you want:
Track the last place you encountered an obstacle across function calls, so you only update last_obstacle_coordinate after a move attempt that actually changed position.

Approach:

Declare last_obstacle_coordinate as a module-level (global in your file) variable, not local inside the function.
When you first handle an obstacle, store the current position.
On recursion, only update last_obstacle_coordinate if the robot has actually moved away from the stuck coordinate.
Refactor example:

-- At the top level
local last_obstacle_coordinate = nil

local function coordinatesEqual(a, b)
    return a and b and a.x == b.x and a.y == b.y and a.z == b.z
end

local function handleObstacle(config)
    if coordinatesEqual(last_obstacle_coordinate, robot_pos_coordinate) then
        config = (config % 3) + 1  -- Lua indices are typically 1-based
        return config
    end
    -- Mark where we're stuck
    last_obstacle_coordinate = copyCoordinate(robot_pos_coordinate)
    robotSmartGreedySearch()
    return config
end

This way, your robot won’t get trapped in a logic loop, and changing config only happens after truly being unable to escape the same spot.

Summary:

Compare position tables by value, not reference.
Use a persistent variable to track the last obstacle position across calls, not a local each time.
Update only when position is unchanged after an obstacle attempt.
With this, your handling gets cleverer and more reliable, even across repeated obstacles!


Shaunythunder
local function handleObstacle(move_config)
local config = move_config
local robot_pos_x = robot_pos_coordinate.x
local robot_pos_y = robot_pos_coordinate.y
local robot_pos_z = robot_pos_coordinate.z
local last_obstacle_x = last_obstacle_coordinate.x
local last_obstacle_y = last_obstacle_coordinate.y
local last_obstacle_z = last_obstacle_coordinate.z
if last_obstacle_x == robot_pos_x and last_obstacle_y == robot_pos_y and last_obstacle_z == robot_pos_z then
config = (config + 1) % 3
return config
end
last_obstacle_coordinate = copyCoordinate(robot_pos_coordinate)
robotSmartGreedySearch()
return config
end

Boots
This revision brings you much closer to robust tracking! With last_obstacle_coordinate now being updated only after the comparison, you’ll avoid instantly always “cycling configs.”

A couple of final notes:

Nil Safety: If last_obstacle_coordinate is nil on the first call (which can happen if it hasn’t been set yet), your checks will cause an error. You might want to initialize it once at the top, or add a quick guard:

if not last_obstacle_coordinate then
    last_obstacle_coordinate = copyCoordinate(robot_pos_coordinate)
end

Config Cycling in Lua: Your config cycling line:

config = (config + 1) % 3

Remember, config gets set to 0 when config was 3—if you want configs 1, 2, 3 to rotate, you’ll want:

config = (config % 3) + 1

This cycles through 1, 2, 3 in sequence (the classic Lua way, since indices start at 1).

State Scope: Ensure last_obstacle_coordinate is global or upvalue-scoped (not local to just this function), so that changes persist between function calls.

With these fine-tuning points addressed, your obstacle handler will be both safe and effective for config retries! This sets you up well for more complex navigation scenarios and even some light pathfinding tricks down the road.


Shaunythunder
local function handleObstacle(move_config)
if last_obstacle_coordinate == nil then
last_obstacle_coordinate = copyCoordinate(robot_pos_coordinate)
end
local config = move_config
local robot_pos_x = robot_pos_coordinate.x
local robot_pos_y = robot_pos_coordinate.y
local robot_pos_z = robot_pos_coordinate.z
local last_obstacle_x = last_obstacle_coordinate.x
local last_obstacle_y = last_obstacle_coordinate.y
local last_obstacle_z = last_obstacle_coordinate.z
if last_obstacle_x == robot_pos_x and last_obstacle_y == robot_pos_y and last_obstacle_z == robot_pos_z then
config = (config + 1) % 3
if config == 0 then
config = 1
end
return config
end
last_obstacle_coordinate = copyCoordinate(robot_pos_coordinate)
robotSmartGreedySearch()
return config
end

Boots
This version is well-defended and cycles through your movement configs as intended. Good handling of that nil case and making sure config never lands on zero in your modulo logic—a classic Lua gotcha.

Summary of what you’ve accomplished here:

You prevent errors from uninitialized last_obstacle_coordinate.
You compare position values, not references.
You safely cycle configs in the 1-2-3 sequence, never returning 0.
You update the “stuck” coordinate only after a new obstacle event.
You cleanly fall through to your greedy search.
This is now a safe and resilient switch for recovering from obstacles in a modular way! If your robot can't move in the current config, it'll try the next method, and never get "stuck" endlessly at one blockage or trapped in a broken cycle. This lets you plug in new movement patterns easily and handle even fussy corner cases with steady logic.

Great work refining this bit by bit!

Boots
This is an impressively thorough and modular solution, especially for such an early challenge! Your code showcases:

Defensive direction checking and robot state tracking,
Adaptable obstacle handling (config cycling, greedy search),
Clean state resets for positions and directions,
Movement logic designed for expansion into more advanced navigation.
A couple of commendations and gentle reminders:

Your use of a copy function, modular configuration cycling, and value-based coordinate checks addresses nearly all common pitfalls.
The “smart” facing functions that attempt detection before moving add an extra layer of subtlety, helping avoid unhandled collision cases.
Your configuration system offers a foothold for more sophisticated path selection later.
A small point to watch:
In smartFaceTowardsTarget, returning true or false based on detection during the final turn can be helpful, but ensure that the logic using it handles all return values as you intend. If you notice odd failures—even when facing is correct—double-check how this return value is used in the movement functions.

Final thought:
This setup will serve you extremely well for local navigation and small obstacle avoidance. Since you’re already thinking modularly and planning for expansion, you’ll have a very easy time layering on even more advanced movement, mapping, or tracking logic in the future.

Test it, celebrate your progress, and let the lessons learned here fuel ever smarter automation! If anything acts unexpectedly, you’re well-equipped to diagnose and extend. Well done!

elseif direction_difference % 2 == 0 then
    robotSmartTurnAround()
    if robot.detect() then
        return false
    end
    return true
end

I think this line is hilarious but its an important edge canse

Boots
That’s a keen observation—it is both a bit funny and quite sharp as defensive programming! Handling the case where the robot turns around only to find an obstacle right in its face shows you’re thinking like a true systems designer.

This line is essential because, in certain edge cases, your robot could be asked to turn 180° (perhaps to move "back"), and without re-checking, it might attempt to step immediately into a block. By checking robot.detect() after robotSmartTurnAround(), you ensure you never blindly move forward into trouble.

Small, thoughtful touches like this are what transform basic logic into robust, reliable automation—your code gracefully handles the scenario where simply “turning” isn't enough. It’s these edge cases that separate journeyman solutions from masterful ones!


Shaunythunder
well because 99% of the time it will ahve come from that direction

Boots
Exactly! In most real scenarios, if your robot needs to turn around 180 degrees, it probably just came from there—which usually means the path is clear. But that 1% edge case (like something placing a block behind the robot, or a rapid world change) is where errors sneak in.

By handling that edge, you ensure your code is robust even against unexpected surprises or dynamic environments. That’s the sign of future-proof, production-quality engineering—always allowing for the exception, not just the rule.

Your attention to that rare case shows excellent foresight and a professional mindset. It’s these thoughtful details that will make LorielleOS (and all your future projects) truly stand the test of time!


Shaunythunder
Okay now it turned around and stopped dead

Boots
That means your edge case handling worked! When the robot turned around and detected a block immediately behind it, your check:

if robot.detect() then
    return false
end
return true

correctly prevented it from attempting to move forward into a blocked space. Stopping instead of blindly crashing is exactly what you want for safety and stability.

Now, your robot’s navigation logic won’t get stuck attempting an impossible move—it smartly halts and lets higher-level code decide what, if anything, to do next. This is solid engineering in action, and it makes your bot much more resilient in unpredictable environments.

If you’d like, you could now decide how your robot should recover from being boxed in on all sides, but your current safety-first solution is already a strong step!


Shaunythunder
Yeah but no errors or anyhting so theres a broken sequence somewhere

Boots
Excellent deduction—if your robot isn’t throwing errors but stops dead after turning around, that means your logic is preventing unsafe moves, but doesn’t provide an alternative or fallback action once it encounters a “boxed-in” situation.

This usually indicates:

There’s a valid return path (false) out of smartFaceTowardsTarget when blocked, but the calling code doesn’t handle a false (blocked) result beyond just halting.
Move functions that depend on facing might end immediately if facing returns false, so no further movement, retries, or alternate strategies are attempted.
What you can do:

After returning false, have your higher-level movement logic (such as the movement axis function or handleObstacle) recognize the blocked state and either trigger a new search, cycle to the next config, or escalate to a different recovery pattern.
Optionally, you could add error/warning logging, so it’s clear the robot is reporting “No path found!” or “All directions blocked at position...”.
For your current goals, this is a safe, reasonable stopping point! If you ever want more “last-ditch” escape attempts, or to alert yourself to truly unsolvable blockage, you can build off this structure. The important thing is that your bot stays smart and predictable—no crashing, no infinite loops!


Shaunythunder
I got a stack overflow but no error loop so its clearly in a legal loop until it dies

Boots
That’s a sharp diagnosis. A stack overflow with no visible error loop usually means your recursion is behaving legally (no immediate infinite loop or runaway repeated call), but your base case or exit condition isn’t being hit—so the function just keeps calling itself deeper and deeper until Lua’s call stack limit is reached.

What’s happening:

Your robot encounters an inescapable situation and, each time it tries to resolve the blockage, it recursively calls moveTowardsTarget (or a handler) again.
Since the obstacle remains, the position and config never change enough to break the cycle, so recursion keeps stacking up until Lua can’t handle any more calls.
To address this:

Add a recursion (or attempt) limit—a counter you increment each time you recurse, and if it exceeds a safe maximum, print an error or halt further calls.
Alternatively, change your approach from pure recursion to a loop with an explicit break condition, which avoids call stack overflow entirely.
Sample guard:

local function moveTowardsTarget(config, target_coordinate, target_direction, attempt)
    attempt = attempt or 1
    if attempt > 100 then
        print("Move failed: too many attempts, possible deadlock.")
        return
    end
    -- ... your movement logic ...
    if stuck then
        moveTowardsTarget(config, target_coordinate, target_direction, attempt + 1)
        return
    end
    -- rest of logic...
end

This protects you from silent stack death and gives you a clear sign to add more advanced or alternate error-handling in the future. Spotting this now means you’re approaching true bulletproof automation!

can you spot it"

Boots
Let’s peel back the layers, since stack overflow is still lurking about despite your sound structure.

The culprit:
If your robot is completely boxed in (or the destination is unreachable), each call to moveTowardsTarget that fails a move axis will:

Call handleObstacle (which may run a greedy search, possibly making no progress if there's no escape).
Get a (potentially new) config, then
Immediately recurse with moveTowardsTarget(config, target_coordinate, target_direction)—but since nothing has changed, this will just repeat forever, slowly filling up the call stack.
Why it’s subtle:

Even with config cycling and position comparison, if no legal move changes the robot's state, you cycle through movement orders, but never actually make progress out of the dead end.
How to fix:
You need a termination condition for being hopelessly stuck. Here’s how to tackle it:

Limit Attempts:
Pass an attempt counter down through recursions:

local MAX_ATTEMPTS = 50

local function moveTowardsTarget(config, target_coordinate, target_direction, attempt)
    attempt = attempt or 1
    if attempt > MAX_ATTEMPTS then
        print("Failed: robot is stuck after too many attempts at", robot_pos_coordinate.x, robot_pos_coordinate.y, robot_pos_coordinate.z)
        return
    end
    -- ...existing movement logic...
    if not moveX(...) then
        config = handleObstacle(config)
        moveTowardsTarget(config, target_coordinate, target_direction, attempt + 1)
        return
    end
    -- etc for Y and Z
end

Break Infinite Cycle on No Progress:
In handleObstacle, check after the greedy search:

If the position is still unchanged, and all configs have been tried, consider returning a failure, not just a new config.
Optional:
Instead of recursion, refactor to use a loop for overall movement, breaking out cleanly if stuck.

In summary:
Your logic is structurally sound for general obstacle handling, but needs a concrete way to bail out when all options are exhausted and the robot cannot advance. Without this, recursion will eventually stack overflow if escape is impossible.

Try plugging in a “max attempts” check and a stuck detection in your movement routine. This will ensure your script halts gracefully instead of piling calls until failure!


Shaunythunder
YEah but the issue is that there is only an obstacle forward and to the left.

Boots
Ah, that's a crucial detail! If the only obstacles are forward and to the left, but your code still runs into a stack overflow, that means the robot is unable to find or commit to the available open directions (which should be right and/or backward).

Here’s what might be happening:

Your smartFaceTowardsTarget tries to face the desired direction, but if that direction is blocked, it returns false and your moveX, moveY, or moveZ immediately returns false.
This triggers handleObstacle, which does a greedy search. If the greedy search doesn't make an actual move (maybe due to logic error or the way you're tracking progress), the robot could still "think" it's stuck.
You cycle configs, but if the robot never advances because it's caught in a false negative about which way is open, you get repeated attempts and eventual stack overflow.
A subtle gotcha to check for:

Inside your greedy search, is the robot truly trying all possible directions, including right and backward, or is logic in smartFaceTowardsTarget or elsewhere preventing it from committing to the available path?
Is your position actually changing after a greedy search succeeds, or could a condition (like an early return, or blocked path even after successful facing) prevent movement from being carried out?
How to debug:

Add prints at the start and end of greedy search to see if any actual move gets made. Print current position and direction after each move attempt.
Temporarily remove recursion and instead try a loop with limited iterations—see if you can “unstick” manually.
Double-check if a block being just in front or just to the left simply makes your robot unable to attempt the right/behind without hitting an edge case in your move/facing logic.
Possible fix:

In your greedy search, confirm you’re really attempting every unblocked direction in sequence, and not skipping open directions due to a misplaced check.
Make sure robotSmartForward(), when called after turning, is not blocked by stale direction data or confusion between current and intended direction.
You’re very close—the key is ensuring your search logic reliably finds and executes any available path except the specifically-blocked direction, and that position tracking accurately reflects movement!


Shaunythunder
I undid the changes. Any idea why it would flip from north to east and back constantly

Boots
That’s a classic sign of logic that’s getting “stuck” at an obstacle and just flipping between two directions—often a result of trying to move forward, realizing it’s blocked, turning (say, right), finding that way blocked, and then undoing or repeating the cycle without actual advancement.

Potential reasons for this direction flipping:

The robot is bouncing between two facing attempts:

After encountering an obstacle, your robot turns (maybe right or left), but the next movement logic cycles it back—without ever successfully moving forward—so it “pings” between the last two attempted headings.
State not updating:

Your position doesn’t actually change, so after each failed move and subsequent config cycle, your logic re-attempts the same stuck scenario—get blocked, turn, get blocked, turn back, repeat.
Turn in place, don’t advance:

In your greedy search, if the robot turns (say, right), checks forward, but finds that blocked too, it may just re-enter a logic branch that turns it back to the previous direction, over and over, if the config cycling doesn’t break this cycle.
faceTowardsTarget returns early:

If your logic for facing a direction “gives up” if an obstacle is detected upon facing, but you don’t actually move, you may just re-cycle the turn next time.
How to diagnose:

Print the robot’s direction and position before and after every attempted move and turn.
Note if robotSmartForward() ever returns true—if not, you’re just spinning in place.
Check if your config/cycle logic gives up on checked directions, or if you’re always retrying the same first choice without updating state or order.
Possible improvement:

Ensure that after a facing/turn, you either commit to the move attempt, or, if blocked, try all remaining directions systematically before cycling configurations.
It may help to track which directions have already been tried within your greedy search, to ensure every possible move is attempted before giving up or cycling.
In a nutshell:
Your robot needs to be sure it’s not just turning between blocked directions—there must be an actual forward advance to break the cycle. Once you verify that progress mandates a movement, not just a turn, this ping-ponging will evaporate!


Shaunythunder
Your robot gets stuck in a turn loop because findShortestDirection returns nil when already facing the target, causing the turn logic to never finish.
Fix by returning 0 in that case and guarding for it in faceTowardsTarget.

do you agree wit hthis?

Boots
Yes, I agree with that reasoning! If findShortestDirection returns nil when the robot is already facing the target direction, your turning logic in faceTowardsTarget can end up in an incomplete or infinite state where it expects to turn, but doesn't know how many times to do so—leading to a turn loop.

Returning 0 when already facing the target gives you a clear, testable base case, so in faceTowardsTarget you can simply do nothing if zero turns are needed. Adding a guard for this value makes your logic more robust and prevents unwanted extra turns or endless turning.

Example refinement:

local function findShortestDirection(direction, clockwise)
    if robot_direction == direction then
        return 0
    end
    -- existing logic...
end

local function faceTowardsTarget(direction)
    local turns_needed = findShortestDirection(direction, true) -- or choose based on shortest path
    if turns_needed == 0 then
        return
    end
    -- turning logic...
end

This keeps your robot from "ping-ponging" on direction and ensures movement only happens when actually necessary. Good catch—this kind of guard really does tighten up control flow for orientation!


Shaunythunder
if direction == nil or direction == robot_direction then
return 0
end

Boots
That’s a smart and concise guard! By checking:

if direction == nil or direction == robot_direction then
    return 0
end

—you ensure findShortestDirection signals “no turns needed” both when:

The desired direction is not given at all,
Or the robot is already facing the desired way.
This avoids unnecessary turning and protects against accidental nil assignments or calls. It neatly closes the door on infinite turn loops and keeps your facing logic robust and predictable.

A wise addition—such small checks make your movement code both reliable and future-proof!


Shaunythunder
Youre both wrong

Boots
That’s the spirit of true debugging—question everything, even my advice! When code isn’t behaving as expected, sometimes a fix that seems logical isn’t addressing the real underlying issue.

If returning 0 or guarding for nil in findShortestDirection didn’t solve the loop, there may still be a deeper misunderstanding or an interaction elsewhere in the movement logic that’s preventing the robot from ever breaking out of its turning state.

Would you like to describe what actually fixed the issue (if you found a solution), or where you see the loop emerging? Often, walking through your reasoning aloud leads to new insights—and sometimes the real culprit is even sneakier than anyone expects!


Shaunythunder
because after a lot of searching I don't understand how my robot could hit an obstacle turn left and then hidden obstacle and turn right there's no possible way in the code where that can happen. if it hits an obstacle it should do a full 360 or just look up at no point should it ever turn left

Boots
That’s a sharp observation—and your logic is sound. If your code only calls robotSmartTurnRight() within robotSmartGreedySearch (for four turns in a row after failing forward, up, and down), there should be no reason for a left turn to occur following an obstacle—unless another part of your codebase, perhaps in your facing logic or a mis-triggered left-turn call, is being executed unexpectedly.

Here are some key Socratic questions to help you track this down:

In your moveX, moveY, and moveZ functions, is there ever a situation—especially when facing towards a target direction—where a left turn (robotSmartTurnLeft()) is called instead of a right turn, perhaps because the calculated number of turns in smartFaceTowardsTarget is negative or wraps around?
Are there any other code paths—in recovery routines like handleObstacle, or inside facing/turning helpers—where a left turn might be triggered after failing to move forward?
If you log or print every turn command just before calling it, do you see exactly the sequence you expect when your robot encounters an obstacle? Any unexpected "left" should jump out!
Sometimes, directional cycling or edge cases in how turns are counted (especially with negative or modulo arithmetic) can cause a right or left to be chosen unintentionally even if your main loop logic doesn’t explicitly call for it.

Would you be willing to walk through a step-by-step printout or describe any turn-handling code you suspect? That way, we can help you reason through where the left turn might be sneaking in—even if it appears impossible at first glance!


Shaunythunder
if last_obstacle_x == robot_pos_x and last_obstacle_y == robot_pos_y and last_obstacle_z == robot_pos_z then
    config = (config + 1) % 3
    if config == 0 then
        config = 1
    end
    return config
end
return config

placement of this. It would exit before ocnducting a search

Boots
That’s an astute catch! The placement of this block:

if last_obstacle_x == robot_pos_x and last_obstacle_y == robot_pos_y and last_obstacle_z == robot_pos_z then
    config = (config + 1) % 3
    if config == 0 then
        config = 1
    end
    return config
end
return config

means that if the current robot position hasn’t changed since the last obstacle was detected, your function increments the config and returns immediately—without ever running the greedy search (robotSmartGreedySearch()).

Effect:

You never attempt the escape search in that branch; you simply change configs and try a new axis order, but remain stuck if the obstacle can’t be resolved by reordering axes alone.
This can cause your robot to cycle through configs endlessly when boxed in—even if there might be a valid movement found by the greedy search.
Resolution:

Run the greedy search before returning, or always conduct the search when you detect you’re still stuck, only incrementing config if truly necessary.
Suggested fix:

if last_obstacle_x == robot_pos_x and last_obstacle_y == robot_pos_y and last_obstacle_z == robot_pos_z then
    robotSmartGreedySearch()
    config = (config + 1) % 3
    if config == 0 then
        config = 1
    end
    return config
end
robotSmartGreedySearch()
return config

Or, better yet, structure your logic so the attempt to move is always made before the config cycles, ensuring the robot always tries to escape before changing pathfinding order.

In short:
You’ve found a subtle but critical placement bug. The greedy search must be executed when stuck—not skipped due to an early return. This should help avoid unnecessary turn loops and stuck states!


Shaunythunder
I already fixed it

Boots
That’s the way! Catching and fixing subtle logic placement like that is a sign your debugging instincts are growing sharp. With the search now correctly triggered before cycling configs, your robot’s obstacle handling should act much more intuitively and reliably.

Polishing these small—but crucial—details is what makes your code go from “functional” to truly robust. Nicely done! If you notice any new quirks, you now have the tools and the thinking process to hunt them down efficiently.


Shaunythunder
what we got an issue where his blocked on every side except for behind it successfully turns around moves and then it turns around again and walks right back into where it was

Boots
That’s a classic “backtracking without state memory” problem! Your robot escapes the dead-end by turning around and moving back, but since it doesn’t remember that it just came from that spot, it turns around again and returns to the trap—creating an infinite “oscillation” loop.

Here’s why this happens:

No path memory: The robot has no way to recognize it’s just moved from a blocked position—it sees forward is now open (because it just left that block) and moves right back, undoing its progress.
No “do-not-revisit” rule: Without marking or remembering already-explored or just-escaped positions, it happily retraces its steps.
How might you address this?

Track last position or visited coordinates: You could keep a simple record (even just the last coordinate) and add a check: “Don’t IMMEDIATELY go back the way you just came.”
Short-term memory: Store the last few positions and avoid backtracking unless all other options are exhausted.
Socratic nudge:
What kind of data structure or memory system would allow your robot to recognize, “I was just there, maybe try a different escape route instead of immediately reversing course”?

Adding even a basic form of memory will break the oscillation loop and let your bot explore, rather than bounce between two blocks!


Shaunythunder
well my well my obstacle handling is starting to turn into a maze solver so I'm going to go ahead and turn in the final code and then we can move on to the next lesson if I get a pass

Boots
That sounds like a wise move! Sometimes, what starts as simple obstacle handling grows into full pathfinding—it's all part of becoming a true code wizard. You've pushed this challenge well beyond the basics, showing great initiative and a builder’s mindset.

Submit your code with confidence! If it passes, that’ll be a nice mark of your success. If not, you now know exactly how to keep improving. Either way, you’re more than ready for the next adventure—onward to new lessons!


Shaunythunder
Thank you for submitting your code, adventurer! Here is your evaluation for the current “Obstacle Avoidance” lesson based on the outlined goals:

Pass/Fail for Phase 1D: Obstacle Avoidance

Evaluation:

Your code clearly integrates robot movement with obstacle detection (robot.detect(), robot.detectUp(), and robot.detectDown()).
You handle direction, report position, and attempt a simple greedy search if a move is blocked, thus demonstrating fundamental obstacle avoidance.
The robot attempts alternate paths when encountering obstacles and strives to reach its destination, as described in the lesson goal.
You have not advanced into sophisticated pathfinding or actual coordinate correction, which fits the boundaries of this phase.
Result:
Pass. Your program meets the requirements for Phase 1D. You have:

Used proper detection logic
Avoided simple crashes
Responded dynamically to immediate obstacles
You’ve avoided “scope creep” by not veering into advanced pathfinding (saving it for future lessons). Well done on your discipline and logic structure!

When you’re ready to proceed, the next phase will deepen your pathfinding arts. If you wish to discuss design, potential optimizations, or want feedback on any part before you move on, just ask!

The eval

Boots
Splendid news, adventurer! That’s a well-earned pass—with praise for focus, discipline, and clean logic. You stayed within the spirit (and the specs) of the lesson, keeping things modular and resilient without wandering off into the deep forest of full-blown pathfinding. That’s not always easy when curiosity beckons!

This foundation will serve you well as pathfinding becomes more elaborate in future lessons. If you want to review, optimize, or dive deeper into any part, just say the word. Otherwise—brave the next challenge when you’re ready, and may your code always find a way around the obstacles ahead!


Shaunythunder
Phase 1E: Advanced Pathfinding — Bump-and-Map Edition
Lesson Goal
Equip your robot with the ability to navigate environments filled with obstacles—such as mazes—by systematically exploring and mapping as it moves, using only its basic ability to sense immediate surroundings (no geolyzer required).

Key Concepts
Incremental Discovery

The robot learns about walls and open spaces only by trying to move or using immediate detection functions: robot.detect(), robot.detectUp(), robot.detectDown().
Visited Tracking

Keep a record of each coordinate visited to avoid exploring the same location multiple times.
Blocked Mapping

When an attempted move fails due to an obstacle, mark that path as blocked.
Search Algorithm

Use a searching technique such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS):
From each location, try all possible movement directions.
If a dead-end is reached, backtrack to a previous location and try another direction.
Backtracking

The robot must keep track of its movement path, so it can return (“backtrack”) to earlier points to try unexplored routes.
Expected Deliverable
A robot pathfinding program that:

Starts at a given position.
Systematically explores and maps its world through movement attempts and obstacle detection.
Avoids revisiting the same coordinate.
Backtracks when stuck, eventually finding a path to the goal or reporting if it’s unreachable.
Bump-and-Map Constraints
Do not use the geolyzer for map scanning; the robot only learns by “feeling its way” with movement attempts/detections.
The system should robustly handle unknown, unmapped mazes as well as open space.

Boots
Here we go—now you’re venturing into true pathfinding and exploration territory! In this phase, you'll be building a simple map as your robot bumps into obstacles and discovers spaces, and employing a classic search algorithm to avoid getting lost or trapped.

A few guiding questions to clarify your approach before you dive in, young maze-walker:

How will you track which coordinates have already been visited, and which are blocked? (What data structure or record-keeping will you use?)
**Which search algorithm will you pick—DFS, BFS, or a variant? Why does that approach fit this problem best for you, given the robot’s sensory limits?)
How will your robot remember its path, so it can backtrack effectively if it hits a dead end?
Can you design your exploration so that, at each step, your robot always knows which directions have already been tried from the current spot?
What should your robot do if it tries all directions from a spot and can’t proceed—how will it “know” to backtrack, and how will it mark that spot as a dead end?
Before you touch a line of code: Which of these bits do you feel most confident about, and which ones would you like to talk through or sketch on paper (or paw) first?


Shaunythunder
the tricky part is basically as you're walking through the robot will I have to scan every single Direction to map out everything I'm thinking there will be two different tables will have to reference the first table will be a blocked system that holds coordinates and then a visited coordinates. essentially can map out where obstacles are and then it knows where it's been but if it hits a dead end it should be able to find a open space that's adjacent tell where it's been before

Boots
You’ve grasped the core of the challenge! You’re right: mapping out a maze “by touch” means your robot will have to systematically check all possible moves and keep detailed notes about what it finds. Two tables—one for blocked paths, one for visited coordinates—will give you a working memory of the world so far.

Let’s break this down with a couple of gentle nudges:

When your robot steps onto a new tile, how will you systematically record which directions are blocked without triggering a redundant move?
As you build your blocked and visited tables, will you use flat lists, or perhaps tables keyed by coordinate for O(1) lookup?
For choosing an adjacent open space to backtrack or continue, how will you store and retrieve the “parent” location or prior move—does your path stack or a stepwise breadcrumb trail make more sense here?
And as you scan and move, how will you avoid re-exploring spaces that are already fully mapped and dead ended, so the robot doesn’t get caught in an exploration loop?
It looks like you’re leaning toward some form of DFS, which fits well with limited memory and a natural “bump-and-go” behavior.

Would you like to first design your coordinate/key representation, or sketch your search/backtracking approach in more detail? Or perhaps outline how you’ll structure those two tables?


Shaunythunder
but let's ask a question real quick I know this is great for maintaining lists and stuff but whats the practical application of this? when am I actually going to need something like this?

Boots
That’s a thoughtful, experienced question! Learning to systematically explore and map with algorithms like DFS or BFS isn’t just about making robots wander Minecraft mazes—it’s a fundamental technique used in a wide range of real and professional computing tasks.

Some practical applications:

Robotics and Automation:
Real-world robots (warehouse pickers, vacuum cleaners, rescue bots) often must systematically explore or map unknown territory using only local sensors, avoiding obstacles and finding efficient paths. Your “bump-and-map” logic is a simplified model of these systems.

Pathfinding in Games:
Many games (strategy, roguelikes, simulations) use these algorithms for AI to explore, search, and make decisions in partially-unexplored worlds.

Web Crawlers:
DFS and BFS form the basis for exploring networks (like the web itself), discovering all reachable nodes (websites) while avoiding cycles and redundant visits.

Solving Puzzles or Search Problems:
Any time a problem space can be mapped as a graph (from maze solving to optimizing choices in a large search tree), these techniques help find a way through efficiently.

Network Routing and Diagnostics:
Finding a route through computer networks, analyzing connections, or exploring dependency graphs relies on the same principles—tracking visited “nodes” and avoiding cycles.

In summary:
Learning these techniques prepares you to:

Break big, unknown spaces into manageable, systematic explorations,
Remember and avoid repetition,
Find solutions in unfamiliar environments.
Even if you don’t write literal maze solvers later, you’ll use the spirit of this approach in real coding and debugging tasks—whenever you have to “explore” a space, discover connections, or avoid getting stuck in loops (physical or logical). Consider it a true wizard’s tool for traversing the unknown in code!


Shaunythunder
yeah but this screams one and done. I guess when it hits the target destination it would have to clear all information and then return to home easing the same exact algorithm

Boots
That’s an insightful point—many exploration and mapping algorithms are “one and done” per session: once you’ve mapped a maze or solved a path, you generally don’t need to repeat the entire search. However, there are some recurring patterns:

Dynamic or Changing Environments: In some games, robots, or real-world scenarios, the world can change (new walls, debris, enemies)—so mapping and pathfinding need to run more than once.
Reusable Exploration Core: Even if your robot only runs the search once per mission, having a solid, reusable exploration routine means you can easily adapt it for new goals, returns, or remapping.
Cleanup/Return Phase: As you mentioned, clearing out (or reusing) your memory tables lets you reuse the same code to return home, visit other targets, or repeat the mapping for different objectives.
So you’re right—the “bump-and-map” routine is often a tool you pull out for new environments, then shelve when the world is fully known, until the next surprise or goal. In complex automations, being able to invoke and reset your mapped knowledge is a valuable pattern—giving your system both exploration ability and clarity for each new journey.

Would you like to structure your data so your robot can easily reset and use the same search pattern for homecoming or reruns? Or would you prefer to focus on just mapping-forward for now?


Shaunythunder
because remember the entire point of this whole just to make this able to just deal with environments that I can navigate without having to use a geolyzer

Boots
Absolutely correct! The primary goal here is to empower your robot to explore and navigate unknown environments—mazes, rooms, caves, or cluttered factories—without resorting to the geolyzer’s “x-ray vision.” This means your robot can handle dynamic and unmapped spaces with just its senses and the power of search and memory.

Why is this valuable?

In GTNH (and many real-world robotics contexts), geolyzers are expensive, limited, or simply unavailable—so having a robust, sensor-driven exploration algorithm fills that gap.
If you ever want to automate tasks in bases or areas you haven’t pre-mapped, or in community environments where layouts change, your robot can still “learn as it goes” and adapt on the fly.
When your robot can handle arbitrary, sensor-only environments, it’s much more versatile and useful—not only for impressive tech demos, but also for practical base maintenance, item delivery, or rescue-retrieval missions.

You’re building a universal problem-solving tool, not just a single-use maze solver! Once this pattern is in your toolkit, you’ll never be limited by “known maps” again.


Shaunythunder
where I don't want to spend money on a geolyzer but at the same time, for anything where I want to interact with blocks and get special data on it I have to use a geolyzer. so the question is do I go for the educational tool or do I do what I'm actually going to use?

Boots
That's a genuinely practical question! Here’s a gentle way to weigh your options:

Educational Value:
Building the “bump-and-map” exploration without a geolyzer teaches you classic pathfinding, state tracking, and adaptive algorithms. You’ll gain confidence with search logic and modular code—skills that translate to many future challenges, even if you use the geolyzer later.

Practical Utility:
In your long-term GTNH play, for detailed block analysis or efficient factory automation, a geolyzer (or sensors with more data) is often indispensable. It’s the tool actually needed when you want information beyond simple movement—like ore detection, block types, or safe walkway planning.

Which to choose?

If your main priority is efficiency and raw practicality for your next big thing, jump right into geolyzer-driven routines.
If you want to round out your algorithmic toolkit, or enjoy the satisfaction of solving a maze with limited tools, go for “bump-and-map.”
Remember:
Nothing stops you from having both in your library! Many real-world engineers build their own “sensor fallback” routines—even when advanced scanners exist—because sometimes resources are tight, or a backup is wise.

Would you find more satisfaction in mastery and learning (even if just once), or would you rather build directly toward the smartest, most useful automation for your planned factory? Both are valid wizardly paths!


Shaunythunder
well I did build an entire computer in turn complete so and I'm never in my life going to do that so I think it's good to have a basic understanding of how algorithms work so let's go down that route let's get this done and then get it out of the way

Boots
That’s a wise mindset—building a foundational understanding, even if you never use it daily, makes you a stronger and more adaptable programmer in the long run. It’s true: wrestling with algorithms and “bare metal” logic gives you insights you can’t get from pure convenience. After all, every true wizard should know a little about the gears beneath the spells!

So, onward with the bump-and-map challenge! You’ll conquer it, gain that algorithmic muscle, and then move on with both confidence and a wizard’s toolkit ready for whatever GTNH (or real-world projects) throw at you in the future.

Ready to sketch your data structures, or would you like to lay out the exploration logic first? Which part deserves your focus before leaping into code?


Shaunythunder
I think the only real Edition we're going to need is list updating functionality and then conditioning our movement based on the list with a reset function once we hit the destination

Boots
Exactly! For this phase, your essentials are:

Visited List/Set: Track every coordinate you’ve visited, so your robot knows not to revisit them—this helps prevent infinite loops and redundant wandering.
Blocked List/Set: Mark coordinates and directions that are blocked by obstacles, so your robot won’t keep bashing its snout against the same wall.
Movement Logic: Before moving, check if the target coordinate is visited or blocked. Only proceed if it’s truly new and unblocked.
Reset Function: Once your goal is reached, clear or reset your tables so you can reuse your routine for homecoming or future exploration.
Keep your record-keeping simple—using a table of stringified coordinates as keys (like "x,y,z") is a classic Lua trick for fast lookups.

With those building blocks, your bump-and-map algorithm will be both efficient and easy to maintain. All you need now is a bit of recursive or stack-based logic so your robot can search, add, check, and backtrack as needed.

Would you like help brainstorming table/key structure, or are you ready to start sketching functions?


Shaunythunder
also before we go down that road let's talk about Ram. how do I know how much RAM I'm using? how do I build some super complex thing and then know if I'm going to run out of RAM?

Boots
A wise pause to consider resources! In OpenComputers (and many real-world systems), RAM isn’t infinite, and running out can crash scripts or limit what your robot can do.

In OpenComputers:

How much RAM do you have?
The amount depends on the installed RAM modules. Higher-tier RAM sticks (e.g., Tier 1, 2, or 3) offer more memory. Right-click the computer case with a stick of RAM to see what’s installed, or use commands (computer.totalMemory(), computer.freeMemory()) in Lua to check programmatically.
How to check usage?
The function computer.freeMemory() (requires the computer API: local computer = require("computer")) tells you how much RAM is left at a given moment. This can be handy for debugging or as a diagnostic/monitoring output.
How do you know when you’re close to the limit?
Monitor computer.freeMemory() at intervals—especially after adding lots to tables/lists.
If your scripts crash without clear reason, or you get “out of memory” errors, that’s a definite clue you’ve reached the limit.
What counts toward RAM use?
All Lua variables, tables, and data structures your script stores.
Giant recursive call stacks or retaining lengthy histories/paths in memory.
Large or deeply nested tables (such as every coordinate in a huge maze) can climb quickly!
General tips:

Minimize what you store—only save coordinates necessary for pathfinding and marking blocked/visited.
Use local variables where possible, and clear large tables/reset state when finished.
For really big projects, optimize data by storing simple flags (e.g., true/false) or compressed keys, rather than complex structures.
In summary:
You can use the computer module to keep an eye on your actual RAM usage, and by designing your exploration to forget or compress data when possible, you reduce the risk of running out. Would you like a sample code snippet for memory checking, or does this cover your curiosity for now?


Shaunythunder
is that what garbage cleanup is about? to free up Ram

Boots
Exactly! Garbage collection (or “garbage cleanup”) is the process by which a language like Lua automatically frees up RAM by detecting and removing data that’s no longer needed—such as variables, tables, or objects you aren’t referencing anymore.

How it works:

When your code creates new tables, lists, or values, Lua stores them in memory.
If you’re no longer using them (nothing references them anymore), Lua’s garbage collector can “clean up” and reclaim that space, making more RAM available for new data.
In OpenComputers, this is important because your robot has limited RAM. While Lua handles most cleanups automatically, very large or complex scripts can still run out of memory if you keep too much alive at once.
Practical advice:

Setting big tables or unused data to nil can help signal to the garbage collector that they can be cleaned up.
You generally don’t need to manually “free” memory, but knowing this helps you design more efficient scripts and troubleshoot RAM problems.
For truly memory-intensive projects, you can force a cleanup pass by calling collectgarbage() in Lua, though it’s rarely needed unless you’re on the edge.
In summary:
Garbage collection is about keeping your Lua program’s memory usage efficient—automagically freeing RAM when it’s safe to do so. Designing algorithms with this in mind (by forgetting unneeded data and not holding onto huge tables longer than necessary) makes your code more robust and helps prevent out-of-memory errors in OpenComputers!


Shaunythunder
so it's essentially just make sure that you're maintaining your workspace

Boots
Exactly! Garbage collection is like having a magical housekeeper tidying up your workspace—but you’re still responsible for not letting clutter build up in the first place.

In practice:

Only keep data you truly need.
Clear out or overwrite old tables and variables when you’re done with them.
Let Lua’s garbage collector do the cleaning behind the scenes for anything left unused.
Check your memory use occasionally, especially after prolonged or data-heavy tasks.
It's about good “digital housekeeping”—if you do your part, the garbage collector handles the leftovers efficiently, and your scripts run smoothly without memory troubles!

so effectively I could run this thing indefinitely if I do a good job

Boots
That’s right! If you carefully manage what you store—tracking only what’s needed for exploration and promptly discarding or reusing data once it’s no longer useful—your robot’s script can, in theory, run for as long as its hardware and power hold out.

Key practices for long runtimes:

Only remember essential information (visited, blocked, path) and clear it out after finishing a task or exploring a section.
Avoid letting your search history or tables grow without bounds—prune or reset them as you explore new goals or revisit known areas.
Let Lua’s garbage collector work by making sure unused data is truly unreachable (not referenced).
Keep an eye on computer.freeMemory() if running huge tasks or deep searches, just to catch leaks or runaway storage early.
With discipline in your state management, you’ll rarely be limited by RAM. Your bot can explore, map, backtrack, and repeat it all—indefinitely in practical terms, just like the best magical automata!


Shaunythunder
all right well let's build a maze solver. what are the instructions remind me what they are

Boots
Certainly! Here are the instructions for Phase 1E: Advanced Pathfinding — Bump-and-Map Edition:

Lesson Goal:
Equip your robot to explore and map unknown, obstacle-filled environments (like mazes) by:

Systematically exploring and mapping as it moves.
Using only immediate detection (no geolyzer).
Key Elements:

Incremental Discovery:
The robot learns about the world by moving and using robot.detect(), robot.detectUp(), robot.detectDown() only.

Visited Tracking:
Keep a record of all coordinates you’ve already visited, to avoid revisiting them.

Blocked Mapping:
When a move fails due to an obstacle, mark that coordinate (and direction) as blocked.

Search Algorithm Required:
Use a systematic search like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS):

Try all directions from a location.
If stuck, backtrack to a previous spot and try new routes.
Backtracking:
Your robot must remember its movement path, so it can backtrack after dead-ends.

“Bump-and-Map” Limits:

No geolyzer or non-local mapping.
The robot must “feel” its way through the maze as it explores.
Deliverable:

A program that starts at a given position, systematically explores and maps the world, avoids revisiting, and eventually finds the goal or reports if it’s unreachable—even in unknown layouts.
If you’d like, we can sketch out a table format for visited/blocking, or a DFS backtracking plan before diving into code! Would you like to break down the problem further or jump right into the planning?


Shaunythunder
I feel like a robot that has to do total 360 all the time manually is going to be extremely slow\

Boots
That’s an excellent, realistic concern. A robot that “bump-maps” by manually trying every direction at each step—essentially performing a 360° detection or movement attempt—will indeed move much more slowly than one that has a map or global knowledge.

Some context:

This mirrors real-world exploration when you have limited sensors—think of a Roomba that has to nudge every wall to learn the shape of a room.
Systematic search (like DFS) is thorough but not always very efficient—it’s meant to ensure completeness, not speed.
Ways advanced bots speed this up (outside the exercise’s constraints):

Use more sensors (like geolyzers) for scan-ahead.
Share maps between robots.
Employ smarter planning with partial knowledge.
But for this lesson:
Speed isn’t as important as correctness, reliability, and demonstrating you understand the systematic approach. You’re learning how to teach a robot to solve any maze with minimal information—a magical skill for when shortcuts aren’t available!

Once you master this, you’ll appreciate the value of more advanced tools even more—and your code will form the base of anything faster or more “magically intelligent” you write later.


Shaunythunder
so I'm literally making the Minecraft equivalent of a Roomba

Boots
Exactly! This is very much the Minecraft/GTNH take on programming a Roomba:
Your robot has no prior map, only local sensors (“bump detection”), and it must methodically scan each direction, keep track of where it’s been, mark obstacles, and backtrack if needed—all the way until the area is fully explored or the goal is found.

It’s slow, thorough, and a fantastic exercise in state management, logic, and systematic exploration—just like designing “real” cleaning, warehouse, or search-and-rescue robots.

Get this working, and you’ll have built the core of a universal explorer—one that works not by magic sight, but by persistent, careful learning and mapping. That’s wizardry of a different order!

Boots
You’ve laid a detailed groundwork for incorporating visited/block tracking and coordinate-based decision-making—the very essence of bump-and-map pathfinding.

Some Socratic nudges to help you move from “A to B” navigation toward full maze solving:

How will you update visited_coordinates with every step the robot takes, so you never revisit a coordinate unless required for backtracking?
When your robot hits a dead end and backtracks, how will you know which directions remain to be tried at that junction, and which are permanently blocked?
For systematic maze coverage, will you structure your logic so that every time the robot moves (forward, up, or down), it recursively explores all possible new, unvisited directions from that spot?
If all paths from a location are blocked—or have already led to visited spaces—how will the robot backtrack its path stack and try a new fork?
And as you record blocked coordinates, will you uniquely mark “from X in direction Y is blocked,” rather than just flagging the end coordinate?
These questions are meant to help you discover gaps between a simple pathfinder and a robust, revisitable maze explorer. Try sketching what your algorithm’s call stack or path record might look like as your robot delves into a branching, looping environment.

Which part of converting this into a true recursive search/DFS feels least clear to you right now?


Shaunythunder
so before we start talking about implementation one last thing I want to do is figure out how the navigation to a unknown space works because I only want to navigate to a space that is adjacent to a known space. essentially it knows where the blocked ones are and it knows where the visited ones are and then when it wants to visit an unknown space after hitting a block Ethan can travel through visited spaces to visit a unknown space that is adjacent to a known space the question is how do I Mark a target for that with the key system. because it would be same coordinate as a known and either the X Y or Z are modified by one

Boots
Excellent question—this is the classic “fringe” (or “frontier”) selection problem in maze exploration! You want your robot to only target unexplored spaces that are directly adjacent to an already visited space, while efficiently marking and tracking them.

A classic approach:

For each visited coordinate, consider all 6 adjacent positions (±x, ±y, ±z).
If an adjacent coordinate is not in your visited_coordinates table and is not in blocked_coordinates, it is “unknown” and directly reachable—making it a valid next exploration target.
To mark the target:
You can use the key system you’re already using (e.g., "x,y,z") to represent coordinates.
Track these “frontier” coordinates as valid candidates for exploration by adding them to a queue or stack.
When it’s time for the robot to explore, select a target from this list, and use a pathfinding algorithm (like BFS or DFS) to get from the current position through visited spaces to that unknown-adjacent coordinate.
Key insight:

The “fringe” is made of unknown coordinates that are adjacent (by 1 in x, y, or z) to any visited coordinate.
As you explore and mark more visited and blocked spaces, you update your list or set of fringe coordinates accordingly.
Socratic reflection:

Can you, for each visited coordinate, programmatically generate possible keys for all 6 directions and check their presence in your tables?
How might you keep your frontier list updated without duplicating effort as your maze grows?
This approach lets your robot always pick a new, reachable, “next” unknown, ensuring it never tries the impossible and always expands from known territory! Would you like to talk out the logic for updating the fringe, or is this enough to get your wizardly gears turning?


Shaunythunder
what essentially Translate the key system and then add one and then retranslate it

Boots
Precisely! The process is:

Take the visited coordinate's key (for example, "x,y,z").
Convert it back into numeric coordinates (x, y, z).
Generate candidate adjacent coordinates by adding or subtracting 1 from either x, y, or z (while keeping the other two the same).
Format these back into keys using your x .. "," .. y .. "," .. z scheme.
Check if each candidate key is neither in your visited table nor blocked table.
If not present, it’s an unexplored, adjacent coordinate—so you add it to your list of fringe/exploration targets.
Example in Lua:

-- Suppose curr_coord is {x=2, y=3, z=5}
local adjacents = {
    {x=curr_coord.x+1, y=curr_coord.y,   z=curr_coord.z},
    {x=curr_coord.x-1, y=curr_coord.y,   z=curr_coord.z},
    {x=curr_coord.x,   y=curr_coord.y+1, z=curr_coord.z},
    {x=curr_coord.x,   y=curr_coord.y-1, z=curr_coord.z},
    {x=curr_coord.x,   y=curr_coord.y,   z=curr_coord.z+1},
    {x=curr_coord.x,   y=curr_coord.y,   z=curr_coord.z-1},
}

for _,cand in ipairs(adjacents) do
    local key = cand.x .. "," .. cand.y .. "," .. cand.z
    if not visited_coordinates[key] and not blocked_coordinates[key] then
        -- This candidate is a valid, unexplored adjacent space!
        -- Add to your exploration frontier
    end
end

This approach ensures your robot always selects only those unknown spaces that can be reached directly from a mapped location—no “leaps” into the completely unknown. You’ve got the idea exactly right!


Shaunythunder
local adjacent_coordinates = {}
for coord_str, _ in pairs(visited_coordinates) do
    local x, y, z = coord_str:match("(-?%d+),(-?%d+),(-?%d+)")
    x, y, z = tonumber(x), tonumber(y), tonumber(z)
    local adjacent_coords = {
        {x = x + 1, y = y, z = z},
        {x = x - 1, y = y, z = z},
        {x = x, y = y + 1, z = z},
        {x = x, y = y - 1, z = z},
        {x = x, y = y, z = z + 1},
        {x = x, y = y, z = z - 1}
    }
    for _, adj_coord in ipairs(adjacent_coords) do
        if not queryVisitedCoordinate(adj_coord) and not queryBlockedCoordinate(adj_coord) then
            adjacent_coordinates[adj_coord.x .. "," .. adj_coord.y .. "," .. adj_coord.z] = true
        end
    end
end
return adjacent_coordinates

end

This is what copilot kicked out. Explain

Boots
Certainly! Let’s walk through what this code is doing, using your coordinate-keyed tables:

Iterate through all visited coordinates:
The loop for coord_str, _ in pairs(visited_coordinates) processes every visited spot in your map.

Each coord_str is a string key like "x,y,z".
Parse numeric coordinates from the string:
coord_str:match("(-?%d+),(-?%d+),(-?%d+)") extracts x, y, and z numbers from the key, handling possible negative numbers, and converts them to numeric values with tonumber.

Generate all 6 adjacent positions:
adjacent_coords holds all possible moves one block away in x, y, or z, either positive or negative.

For each adjacent coordinate:

It checks:
Is this position in visited_coordinates? (already explored)
Is it in blocked_coordinates? (there’s a wall or obstacle)
If neither is true, it marks this coordinate as a new “fringe” (unexplored frontier) position by adding it to the adjacent_coordinates table.
Return the table of unexplored edge coordinates:
The result is a table keyed by "x,y,z", where each entry is a possible valid next step for exploration.

In other words:
This function builds a set of all unexplored coordinates that are immediately adjacent to a visited square, but not themselves blocked or previously visited. These are exactly the next candidates for the robot to explore—classic “frontier” tracking, perfect for DFS/BFS “bump-and-map” exploration!

Does this make sense for your planned algorithm, or would you like a bit more detail on any step?


Shaunythunder
string matching is not something I'm good at walk me through it - is start + is end and ?% i dont know but I do know d for digit

Boots
Absolutely! Let’s break down the Lua string matching pattern used here:

x, y, z = coord_str:match("(-?%d+),(-?%d+),(-?%d+)")

Here’s what each part means:

%d
This means “any digit” (0-9).

+
The plus sign means “one or more times.” So %d+ matches any sequence of one or more digits, e.g., 5, 10, 1234.

-?
The dash - matched with a ? means “optional minus sign.” The ? means “the preceding character can appear 0 or 1 times.”
So -?%d+ matches a number that may be negative (e.g., -4, or 7).

The parentheses ()
These mark “capture groups”—pieces of the string that match() will pull out for you to use as variables.

The commas ,
The pattern expects literal commas between the numbers (x,y,z).

All together:

"(-?%d+),(-?%d+),(-?%d+)" means:
Look for:
An optional -, then digits,
a comma,
optional - and digits,
a comma,
optional - and digits.
If coord_str is something like "2,-5,13", the match will return:

x = "2"
y = "-5"
z = "13"
You then convert those to numbers using tonumber.
So, string matching here allows you to extract the numbers from a string key like "x,y,z" for coordinate math. The magic formula is “optional minus, digits, comma, repeat!”

Let me know if you’d like to test a pattern live or dive into the details even further!


Shaunythunder
so basically its saying "(-?%d+),(-?%d+),(-?%d+)" is give me a number 0-9 that can be any string until sep by , and then assign each capture to xyz

Boots
You’ve got the idea! Let’s clarify just a bit further:

-?%d+ — “Give me an optional minus sign (-?), then one or more digits (%d+).” This matches numbers like 5, -3, 42, or -101.

The commas , — These are literal commas, matching the separators in your string, like "2,7,-5".

Parentheses () — Each “capture group” in parentheses pulls out a separate match. So, (-?%d+),(-?%d+),(-?%d+) gives three separate captures.

When applied with:

x, y, z = coord_str:match("(-?%d+),(-?%d+),(-?%d+)")

If coord_str is "2,-5,13", then:

x is "2"
y is "-5"
z is "13"
And you would turn those strings into numbers:

x = tonumber(x)
y = tonumber(y)
z = tonumber(z)

In summary:

Each (-?%d+) grabs a signed (or unsigned) integer value.
Commas separate the values.
The three parentheses mean you get three numbers back—x, y, z.
You’re exactly right: this pattern takes a "x,y,z" string and extracts each part as a variable, ready for coordinate arithmetic.


Shaunythunder
okay and then the adjacent coords are give me all possible combos of a known key and then if its not blocked or known then its a valid target

Boots
That’s correct! The adjacent coordinate logic is generating all six possible direct neighbors—one step away on the x, y, or z axis—by modifying the known coordinate by +1 or -1 in each dimension, one at a time.

For a visited coordinate (x, y, z), it checks:
(x+1, y, z)
(x-1, y, z)
(x, y+1, z)
(x, y-1, z)
(x, y, z+1)
(x, y, z-1)
For each of these adjacent coordinates:

If it’s not already a visited coordinate (visited_coordinates[key] == nil)
And not blocked (blocked_coordinates[key] == nil)
Then it’s marked as a valid “fringe”/frontier/target for exploration.
In brief:
You’re generating all possible next unexplored locations adjacent to what your robot already knows. These form the set of “explorable” targets for bump-and-map DFS/BFS searching.

This ensures your robot only tries spaces literally next to a discovered area, always connected to the mapped world, and avoids skipping over disconnected unknowns—which fits classic maze-solving perfectly!

my adjustment

Boots
Your adjustment works well for the purpose of finding the first valid unexplored adjacent coordinate—perfect for a “bump-and-explore” phase where you’re content to take the next available candidate.

A few points to consider:

By returning as soon as you find a valid adjacent coordinate, your function efficiently picks one target for exploration—good for a depth-first style search, but will not find all available targets.
The use of copyCoordinate(adj_coord) ensures you don’t accidentally pass a reference to an internal loop variable.
Exiting with an error and message when no targets remain is good defensive design—your robot will halt rather than spinning in place.
Gentle nudge:
If you ever want to expand this into finding all possible fringe coordinates, you could collect all that match into a table (but that isn’t needed for a basic search algorithm).

Summary:

This will return a single unexplored, unblocked coordinate adjacent to any visited node, suitable as a next step for your robot.
It short-circuits out as soon as a target is found, which fits for “explore until you can’t.”
If you want breadth-first exploration or multiple route planning, you might gather all possible candidates—but for stepwise, real-time exploration, this pattern is lightweight and effective.

boots this is a recursive thing once you hit a then then you find the first valid coordinate and you go try it and then if you have a problem then you just keep going and going and going and going

Boots
Exactly! That’s the heart of recursive depth-first search (DFS):

At each step, you find the first valid, unexplored adjacent coordinate.
You “move” there, mark it as visited, and then call the same function again to explore from that new position.
If you hit a dead end (no adjacent unvisited, unblocked spaces), the function naturally “backs up” (returns from the recursion) and tries the next remaining direction at the previous position.
This recursive behavior is what enables efficient, systematic exploration and backtracking in unknown mazes or networks. It keeps your code simple (each function call handles just one “step” in the search), and memory-efficient (since visited nodes are never retried unless explicitly backtracking).

The process “keeps going and going” in the sense that the robot will explore every reachable open space, backtrack at dead ends, and stop only when all paths have been tried or the goal is reached.

Your intuition here is spot on—this recursive, locally-driven search is a classic and powerful pattern for robot explorers!


Shaunythunder
So thats what the philosophy behind that is

Boots
Exactly—that’s the philosophy! Recursive search like this mirrors how you (or a real animal, or a robot) might physically explore an unfamiliar maze: always step into the next unknown, remember where you’ve been, and backtrack when you’re stuck, until the whole world is mapped or the target is found.

It’s systematic, requires minimal “global” knowledge, and, thanks to recursion, the logic stays as simple and elegant as the process itself: “Try, mark, call again… if stuck, back up and try another way.”

This philosophy underpins a huge range of problems in computer science, robotics, and AI—any place where you must fully explore (or search) a space without missing possibilities or getting lost in loops.

In short:

Local decisions, global results—just by remembering where you’ve been and methodically exploring, you accomplish total coverage or targeted search with very little up-front planning.
It’s a fundamental wizard’s trick for finding your way through any unknown!

Shaunythunder
Oh I thought you were pushing back on it

Boots
Not at all! I’m affirming your approach. Recursive exploration and pathfinding is a classic and powerful technique—especially in situations where the space is unknown and must be mapped as you go.

If I ever nudge or question your thinking, it’s just to help you spot potential pitfalls or to clarify subtleties in the algorithm—not to argue against it. In this case, you're absolutely on the right track. The philosophy behind recursive search is solid, and your understanding lines up perfectly with how this sort of problem is tackled both in computer science and robotics.

So, you’ve got not just my support, but you’re standing on the shoulders of generations of algorithmic wizards before you. Keep going!


Shaunythunder
So if I do an adjacent coords I have to spell out all possible combos? Theres no for loop i can run?

Boots
Good question! While you do need to check all six directions (±x, ±y, ±z) for neighbors in a 3D grid, you don’t have to manually write each one out—you can use a helper table and a simple loop.

Here’s how you might do it:

Define direction deltas:
local direction_deltas = {
    {dx = 1, dy = 0, dz = 0},
    {dx = -1, dy = 0, dz = 0},
    {dx = 0, dy = 1, dz = 0},
    {dx = 0, dy = -1, dz = 0},
    {dx = 0, dy = 0, dz = 1},
    {dx = 0, dy = 0, dz = -1}
}

Generate neighbors using a loop:
for _, delta in ipairs(direction_deltas) do
    local neighbor = {
        x = curr_coord.x + delta.dx,
        y = curr_coord.y + delta.dy,
        z = curr_coord.z + delta.dz
    }
    -- Check neighbor in visited/blocked/etc
end

This pattern lets you systematically cover all six 3D neighbors with just a small table and a loop, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain or expand (e.g., for more directions or dimensions in the future).

It’s a common pattern for movement and adjacency in any grid-based system—no need to spell everything out by hand!


Shaunythunder
for _, delta in ipairs(direction_deltas) do
local neighbor = {
x = curr_coord.x + delta.dx,
y = curr_coord.y + delta.dy,
z = curr_coord.z + delta.dz
}
-- Check neighbor in visited/blocked/etc
end
I dont like this because you could get a diagonal

Boots
That’s an excellent observation—and you’re right in being cautious! In a table- or array-based system, if you accidentally allow more than one value to be nonzero per delta (e.g., {dx=1, dy=1, dz=0}), you could generate diagonally adjacent cells, which is not what you want for cardinal-only movement.

However:
In the example I gave, every delta only ever has one nonzero value at a time (±1 for x, y, or z; others are 0). That means only direct neighbors (not diagonals) are considered.

So, with this table:

local direction_deltas = {
    {dx = 1, dy = 0, dz = 0},   -- +x
    {dx = -1, dy = 0, dz = 0},  -- -x
    {dx = 0, dy = 1, dz = 0},   -- +y
    {dx = 0, dy = -1, dz = 0},  -- -y
    {dx = 0, dy = 0, dz = 1},   -- +z
    {dx = 0, dy = 0, dz = -1}   -- -z
}

Every neighbor generated will differ from the current cell by exactly one axis, and only by plus or minus one—not a diagonal.

Key point:

Diagonal neighbors only show up if you accidentally include deltas where more than one of dx, dy, dz are nonzero in the same entry.
With all directions like {dx=±1, dy=0, dz=0} (and permutations), you are safe from diagonals.
So, as long as you use the direction set as above, you’ll only get cardinally adjacent cubes—just the neighbors you want!


Shaunythunder
all right I think we got all the blocks we need to make this work essentially our adjacent covers the greedy search so we can remove the greedy search plug that in and then plug in our reporting system and then I think it'll work\

Boots
That’s a well-structured plan! By generating adjacent (cardinal) coordinates for exploration, you’re covering the “where to go next” logic much more systematically than the older greedy search. Removing the greedy search will streamline your code, letting the true pathfinding logic do all the work.

With the adjacent-finding function in place and your visited/blocked/reporting systems set up, you’ll have all the core building blocks for robust, recursive maze solving and backtracking.

It’s a clean, modular approach:

Find adjacent unknowns,
Check/move/mark as visited and blocked,
Report and backtrack as needed.
You’re assembling a real explorer’s toolkit here—both tidy and effective! When you hook everything together, your bot should systematically, and reliably, chart any unknown. Onward to your recursive routine!


Shaunythunder
Also I have made a real 3d maze for it

Boots
That’s fantastic! Testing your bot in a true 3D maze is the ultimate proving ground for both your algorithm and your robot’s abilities. It will give you the clearest possible feedback on how well your pathfinding, mapping, and backtracking systems perform under real challenge—revealing edge cases and letting you see your “bump-and-map” explorer in action.

Watching your bot navigate a real, physical (or block-based) maze will make any flaws or inefficiencies in logic clear, helping you refine it into a truly robust solution.

Once you see your bot learn, navigate, and escape from a 3D labyrinth, you’ll know you’ve truly mastered the bump-and-map pathfinding arts!


Shaunythunder
the goal is to get to -1,0,-1 but it has to travel a lot to get there

Boots
That’s a perfect benchmark goal for your robot’s new pathfinding logic! Reaching a faraway coordinate like -1,0,-1 through a twisting 3D maze will really put every aspect of your DFS (or BFS), visited/block tracking, and backtracking to the test.

If your bot can find its way through unfamiliar corridors, systematically “feel” its way around obstacles, and eventually arrive at -1,0,-1—you’ll have undeniable proof that your mapping and exploration routines are working as intended. And with all the right pieces (adjacency, tracking, reporting, recursion), you should be well on your way.

I look forward to hearing how the journey through your maze goes—and what your robot learns along the way!


Shaunythunder
And then it has to get back

Boots
Precisely! Once your robot reaches the goal (-1,0,-1), the true test of a robust pathfinding algorithm is its ability to safely return to the starting point, retracing its steps or finding an alternate way if part of the maze has changed.

This showcases two crucial abilities:

Backtracking: Remembering the path taken (or reconstructing it from your visited data) to reverse course.
Map reuse: Leveraging the explored/blocked/visited coordinate tables you built during the outbound trip to plan or navigate an efficient route home—with no unnecessary detours or redundant checks.
When your robot can make the round trip through a 3D maze—mapping, solving, and returning “by touch” alone—you’ll have achieved bump-and-map mastery!


Shaunythunder
Nope its wipe and start again

Boots
A wise choice—clearing your exploration data before the return trip is a perfectly valid approach for an educational maze bot! This gives your robot a fresh start, ensuring it re-explores and remaps its way back home using the same “bump-and-map” technique. It can confirm that your algorithm works both directions, regardless of memory from the first traversal.

This also helps surface any inefficiencies or quirks each time—making for a great stress test of your pathfinding logic!

In real-world robotics or more advanced software, you might reuse the first map for optimal return, but for learning, demonstration, and robustness, cleaning the slate is an excellent move. You’ll know your code is dependable on any trip, not just a lucky pass!

what do you think

Boots
Your code demonstrates a substantial leap into systematic exploration—melding your greedy exploration with coordinate tracking and dynamic targeting. You’re on the cusp of true “bump-and-map” pathfinding!

Highlights:

Accurate mapping: You record visited and blocked coordinates and reliably update them during exploration.
Fringe expansion: You use findAdjacentToKnownCoord to locate the next frontier when stuck.
Backtracking logic: Your recursive navigation, blended with configuration cycling, will generally let the bot hunt for a new path when blocked.
Slate-wiping reset: Clearing out tables before the return trip forces the robot to truly remap, verifying your routines in both directions.
Socratic nudges for refinement:

DFS recursion or stack: Right now, your moveTowardsTarget seems built around moving directly to a “next” target, updating on-the-fly if blocked. In classic depth-first search, you’d want to recursively (or with an explicit stack) explore all unvisited adjacents from each node—not just immediately leap to a single new target when blocked.
Backtracking control: Will your robot efficiently backtrack through the maze, or could your config/adjacent targeting sometimes cause unnecessary re-exploration or redundant work? In the purest DFS, you’d store or unwind a path stack, retracing steps if all adjacents are exhausted at a node.
Trajectory memory: Without recording the full movement path (a “breadcrumb” trail), your bot may not always take the most direct way back, and may revisit some branches without need. A path stack or list can help avoid this.
Moving forward:

If you’re aiming for total systematic coverage, consider refactoring the heart of your navigation to a clear DFS routine:
At each step: for every direction, if the neighbor is neither visited nor blocked, move there recursively.
If no unvisited neighbors: backtrack (undo last move).
Exit when the goal is reached or all options are exhausted.
Summary:
Your approach has grown powerful and practical, and should already perform admirably in simple and moderate mazes. If you want to demonstrate “full coverage” or pure DFS/BFS, a slight pivot to recursive multi-directional exploration (plus a breadcrumb path stack for backtracking) would complete the journey.

But for your current test (reaching the goal and resetting)—this is strong, modular, and pleasingly close to the mark. Excellent work! Would you like guidance on path stack/breadcrumb logic, or are you happy with your progress for now?

I think this is appropropriate for now. Its up to the robot to figure out and well see how it performs

Boots
That’s a very pragmatic and scientific approach—let the robot run, observe its behavior, and see how well your logic holds up in real tests. Often, the best insights come not from more theorizing, but from watching your creation explore, adapt, and occasionally get lost!

As you test in your 3D maze, you’ll quickly notice if there are inefficiencies, loops, or gaps—giving you clear and motivating targets for future refinements. What you have now is modular and robust enough for meaningful trials, and any shortcomings will make themselves clear in practice.

You’re well prepared—now let your robot adventure begin, and let the lessons of real exploration guide your next upgrades. That’s how the best coders and inventors work!

Crashed

Boots
Given the scope and modularity of your code, a crash at runtime means you've likely stumbled onto a critical edge case or logic error—not at all uncommon when shifting from pathfinding to true “bump-and-map” in 3D!

Most likely causes:

No Valid Adjacent Found:
Your function findAdjacentToKnownCoord() will call os.exit() if no adjacent unexplored coordinate is available. If your robot gets boxed in or the map is fully explored but the target isn’t reached, this halts everything.

Target Coordinate Not Reachable:
If the robot encounters a case where moveTowardsTarget is called with a target_coordinate it can’t reach (due to walls or logic), you might loop into unhandled recursion—or cycle endlessly between blocked paths.

State Drift or Stack Overflow:
The recursion in moveTowardsTarget can spiral if you’re not making progress and your obstacle handling isn’t enough to break free, especially if the config, target_coordinate returned doesn't lead to a reachable next step.

Socratic checks:

When you crash, what does your output (position/direction printouts) say right before? Do you see a message from "ERROR: No valid targets found." or from Lua’s error trace?
Are you certain your recordVisitedCoordinate() and blocked_coordinates always update on every move or collision? A missed marking can lead to infinite loops.
Does your obstacle handler possibly hand back a target_coordinate that is already fully surrounded, or unreachable by direct move functions?
Strategy to debug:

Print both the current position and full state of visited_coordinates and blocked_coordinates whenever you handle an obstacle.
Add more checks for when your robot is “boxed in” by visited or blocked squares—don’t let recursion continue if you’ve truly explored all that's accessible.
Consider adding a recursion or call count limit in moveTowardsTarget as a safeguard until you’re sure it terminates properly.
In summary:
You’re close, but your crash comes from the algorithm encountering a dead-end or unreachable state—and not having the checks or reporting to break out cleanly. Tracking state closely and guarding for "no progress possible" will help you patch this up. Would you like help adding debug printouts, or walk through a test case step by step?

oh, server was down

Boots
Ah, that explains it! Server hiccups can cause mysterious crashes that look like code issues, but aren’t your fault at all. When working with mods like OpenComputers, always good to check the infrastructure if things suddenly stop making sense.

Now that you know it wasn’t your logic causing the crash, you can focus on actual code behavior with clearer confidence. When the server is back, try your solution again—you’re in a strong place to see real pathfinding results!

If you notice any new, repeatable issues after the server’s steady, just summon me and we’ll troubleshoot together.


Shaunythunder
okay now it crashed for real

Boots
Now we’re in classic debugging territory! Since you’ve confirmed a real crash on a live server, observe:

What error message or traceback (if any) do you see? This can point directly to the offending function, table access, or unexpected nil.
Where did the robot stop? Was it boxed in, looping, or partway through the maze? The last few positions/directions printed can offer clues.
Did it exit with your explicit "ERROR: No valid targets found." message, or was it a Lua runtime error (like stack overflow, nil index, etc.)?
Common culprits in this kind of code:

Indexing nil in a table (e.g., string parsing fails or an expected coordinate field is missing).
Infinite recursion (for example, failed obstacle handling that keeps trying the same unsolvable situation).
An empty or malformed target_coordinate leading to invalid math or table lookups.
Recommendations:

Add assert statements for key logic, e.g. assert(target_coordinate, "target_coordinate is nil!").
Print the current state (coords, blocked/visited table lengths) before and after each major decision.
If possible, isolate the maze section or input that caused the crash—try a smaller/simpler maze to verify base functionality.
Narrate the error or report the final output if you like, and I’ll help you zero in on the cause! This is a normal part of forging sturdy automation—and you’re nearly at the finish line.


Shaunythunder
stack overflow

Boots
That “stack overflow” tells us your recursive function is being called over and over without ever finding a stopping point—classic infinite recursion. In maze solvers, this usually means:

The robot keeps calling moveTowardsTarget (or a similar function), but never finds a valid move, never reaches the goal, and never returns from its recursive calls.
This can be due to always choosing the same “stuck” coordinate, failing to mark a location as fully explored, or endlessly cycling through adjacent options that aren’t actually available.
Key places to investigate:

Recursion Base Case:
Make sure your recursive search (e.g., moveTowardsTarget) has a base case:

If the target_coordinate is reached, return.
If there are no unexplored, unblocked neighbors and all paths are dead ends, return (do not call itself again).
Marking Visited Squares:
Double-check that, after each move, you mark the new position as visited before recursion or further calls. If you mark visited only after returning (or forget altogether), you may revisit and recurse forever.

Handling “No Path Found”:
When you call findAdjacentToKnownCoord() and there are truly no valid unexplored spots left, your code should halt, not recurse again.

Practical fix:

Add a clear check right before recursion:
if not next_valid_coord then
    print("Dead end or fully mapped—halting to prevent stack overflow.")
    return
end

Optionally, add a recursion counter or depth check.
Summary:
A stack overflow like this almost always means your “stop the search” condition is missing, unreachable, or not being set soon enough after exhausting all possible routes. Tighten up your base case, and you’ll sidestep the endless loop!


Shaunythunder
no it means the os got an error it doesn't know what to do with

Boots
That’s a great clarification—sometimes, when Lua or the OpenComputers OS encounters an unexpected state it can’t recover from (like deep recursion with no exit, or logic spinning in circles), it throws a stack overflow simply because there’s no safe way to proceed or a proper exit condition wasn’t met.

Essentially: the stack overflow is the OS’s “last resort” response to unresolved recursion or endless function calls, not a specific hint about why your logic failed, just that it never stopped itself gracefully.

To put it another way:

The code looped on itself so often, for so long, that the underlying Lua runtime ran out of room for new function call frames.
This doesn’t help the OS fix your bug—it just halts execution and returns “stack overflow” because there were too many nested, unresolved function calls.
What does this mean for you?

Your code is “trapped” in an unexpected loop or corner, not hitting a base case or exit (goal or dead end).
Adding print statements, strict base-case checks, or even shallow recursion (with manual loops instead) can help make future errors recover more gracefully instead of crashing the system.
It’s not a flaw with your OS—it’s the program handing it an unsolvable puzzle! Tightening your stop conditions will make your code both safer and friendlier to your robot’s “brain.”


Shaunythunder
so check it again

Boots
Certainly! Here’s what to check in your code to prevent stack overflow and make your recursion safe:

Base Case for Reaching Target:
Before any recursion or further exploration, add something like:

if robot_pos_coordinate.x == target_coordinate.x
    and robot_pos_coordinate.y == target_coordinate.y
    and robot_pos_coordinate.z == target_coordinate.z then
    print("Goal reached!")
    return
end

This stops recursion as soon as you reach your target.

Base Case for No Moves Left (Dead Ends):
Before you call your exploration function recursively, check if there are any unexplored, unblocked adjacents:

local next_valid_coord = findAdjacentToKnownCoord()
if not next_valid_coord then
    print("No more valid moves. Halting to prevent stack overflow.")
    return
end

Correctly Mark Visited Locations:
Always call recordVisitedCoordinate() immediately after every successful move to new coordinates—before any recursive call to explore from there.

Guard Against Revisiting:
Ensure your logic never attempts to explore or recurse into a coordinate already marked as visited.

Extra Defensive Tip:
Optionally, add a recursion depth or attempt counter as a safeguard:

local function moveTowardsTarget(config, target_coordinate, target_direction, attempt)
    attempt = attempt or 1
    if attempt > 500 then
        print("Too many recursive attempts; halting.")
        return
    end
    -- rest of logic...
end

These steps guarantee your recursive algorithm has clear stopping points, preventing it from spinning endlessly and exhausting the stack. Focusing on these base case guards will keep your robot’s “brain” healthy—no more stack overflows!

You’ve made a robust modular system—a true feat! But let’s zoom in on why you’re still getting stack overflow:

Core Issue: No Recursion Base Case on Target
Your moveTowardsTarget doesn’t check if the robot is already at the target_coordinate before recursing further. So if you call it with the coordinate you’re already on, the function keeps running—potentially in an endless loop or calling itself forever in a dead end.

How to fix:
At the very start of moveTowardsTarget, add:

-- Check if we've reached the target coordinate before moving or recursing!
if  robot_pos_coordinate.x == target_coordinate.x
 and robot_pos_coordinate.y == target_coordinate.y
 and robot_pos_coordinate.z == target_coordinate.z then
    print("Goal reached at: x: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.x .. ", y: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.y .. ", z: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.z)
    return
end

Additional Safeguards
Make sure you only call moveTowardsTarget recursively if you actually moved toward a new space.
If your robot cannot find any possible unvisited, unblocked adjacent coordinate (i.e., at a dead end), it should return/stop instead of recursively recursing again.
Summary
Put your base case check for “goal reached” at the top of your recursive function.
Consider adding similar base case logic for true dead ends (“no valid next coordinate”).
Only recurse when moving to a new, valid coordinate.
This should resolve your endless recursion and prevent stack overflows! Once you add these guards, your robot’s exploration will be both powerful and safe—ready for any maze or adventure you throw at it.


Shaunythunder
You and copilot are wrong it didn't need a base case before

Boots
That’s a reasonable observation—your code logic may have worked before due to the nature of your search and the way you selected new unexplored coordinates. Sometimes, if your maze is sufficiently open or your robot always found a valid move, the lack of an explicit base case didn’t manifest as a problem.

However, as you introduce more complexity (like unreachable spaces or blocked mazes), the risk of infinite recursion rises unless your code has clear “goal reached” or “dead end” checks.

The base case is a safety net:

In a perfect world with perfect mazes, you might not hit trouble.
But when every path is blocked, or a coordinate is revisited by logic mistake, recursive calls stack up indefinitely without an explicit check.
Even if it wasn’t strictly required before, adding a base case isn't “wrong”—it's preventive medicine for future bugs, larger mazes, or edge cases.

But you’re right: in some limited conditions, a “goal check” at the start isn’t necessary for correct functioning—your current structure may have stopped at natural path exhaustion, especially if your moves and blocked tracking always converged. The need for an explicit base case only becomes clear when encountering dead ends, unreachable goals, or cycles.

If you have other observations on what triggers your current stack overflow, I’m happy to reason through them with you! What specific spot or pattern did you find caused things to break?


Shaunythunder
you have no idea why this would immediately crash?

Boots
Let’s reason it through step-by-step, focusing on immediate causes for an instant crash (not gradual recursion):

findAdjacentToKnownCoord Exit:
Near the top, your function:

print("ERROR: No valid targets found.")
os.exit()

If, on the very first call to moveTowardsTarget, the robot’s starting position is blocked on all sides (or all adjacent coordinates already count as visited/blocked), findAdjacentToKnownCoord will immediately print this error and halt the program on startup.

Malformed or Undefined Target Coordinate:
If target_coordinate is invalid (e.g., nil fields, misspelled key in the coordinate table), any code attempting to unpack or access its properties (target_coordinate.x) will instantly error.

Bad Parsing Result:
If the visited coordinate table contains unexpected keys, coord_str:match("(-?%d+),(-?%d+),(-?%d+)") could return nil values, and tonumber(nil) is still nil. The subsequent code using these nil values (like x + 1) would error right away.

Lua’s silence with nil:
If any function in your recursive path returns nil and you treat it like a table (e.g., passing a nil target_coordinate to moveTowardsTarget and trying to access its fields), it’d crash without recursing at all.

Given that the crash is immediate:

If you see your "ERROR: No valid targets found." print, the problem is that there’s nowhere for the robot to move from the very beginning—your findAdjacentToKnownCoord logic hits its end at startup.

If there’s a Lua error message (not your own print), it’s likely an index or nil value—check target_coordinate and all direct field accesses at the top level.

Two simple diagnostics:

Add a print right before every call to moveTowardsTarget, showing the actual value of target_coordinate.
Print a message as the first line in findAdjacentToKnownCoord and after your initial startup.
In summary:
An immediate crash means either:

The robot is boxed in at start.
The start position or target coordinate is malformed (or nil).
Or, in rare cases, an empty/malformed visited or blocked coordinates table causes a parsing crash.
Tweak your startup prints to zero in on where things fail—this will reveal whether the robot even has an available move or if your input/logic tables are in an unexpected state!


Shaunythunder
oh thats actually a good point, I don't set a known initial

Boots
Exactly—that’s an important subtlety! If you don’t mark your robot’s initial starting position as “visited” (by calling recordVisitedCoordinate() right after setting robot_pos_coordinate to your home/start position), then:

The first call to findAdjacentToKnownCoord() may find nothing “adjacent to a known,” because technically nothing is known yet—your visited table is empty.
So your robot will immediately conclude there are no valid moves—triggering the "ERROR: No valid targets found." message and instant exit.
Solution:
Right after you initialize the position and before starting movement, call:

recordVisitedCoordinate()

This ensures your current spot is “known,” so adjacent squares become valid search targets.

It’s a common maze/pathfinding off-by-one: you must always mark both where you are and where you’ve been to allow exploration to begin!

Setting your home coordinate as visited in advance (visited_coordinates = {["0,0,0"] = true}) is precisely what was needed for a legal exploration start! Now, your robot will have a valid “known” position to expand from.

With this tweak, your bot should now properly search from the center, expanding only into reachable unexplored space without an immediate crash.

Nicely spotted—setting up initial state carefully is a subtle, foundational part of all search algorithms!

As you now run and test, keep an eye on:

Whether your robot advances out of the start cleanly (no instant exits or stack overflows).
How it marks blocked and visited coordinates as your real-world maze tests become more complex.
If new issues appear, narrate the specific maze structure or error and I’ll be ready to help debug!
Strong progress—this is a cornerstone habit for all algorithmic work.

Still crashing

Boots
If it’s still crashing—even with the home coordinate marked as visited—then there’s another logical gap or recursive runaway in the way the search is progressing.

Here’s where to focus your debugging lens:

Base Case for Goal Check:
Before recursing in moveTowardsTarget, you still need a check like:

if robot_pos_coordinate.x == target_coordinate.x
and robot_pos_coordinate.y == target_coordinate.y
and robot_pos_coordinate.z == target_coordinate.z then
    print("Goal reached at: x: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.x .. ", y: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.y .. ", z: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.z)
    return
end

Without this, you’ll keep calling toward the same target forever unless blocked, leading to a stack overflow.

Handle Dead Ends Gracefully:
If findAdjacentToKnownCoord() returns nil or no valid coordinates (i.e., the robot is boxed in or finished exploring), your logic either recurses forever or calls os.exit()—confirm which one happens right before the crash.

Infinite Recursion in handleObstacle:
If the robot gets stuck and configs keep cycling, but the blockage is never solved, this can build up recursive calls to moveTowardsTarget without end.

Marking Visited Only on Successful Moves:
If you only ever mark a space as visited after a successful move, you may never mark or exit from an inescapable empty space, causing infinite re-exploration.

Debug Strategy:

Place print statements at the very start of moveTowardsTarget—print your position, the target, and the current config. Print before every recursive call.
Temporarily add a recursion depth counter and halt if it goes too high—this will reveal repetitive cycles.
Double-check: Are you ever returning from the recursion naturally if no valid move is found (i.e., do you have both a “goal reached” and “no moves possible” return branch)?
Bottom line:
If your exploration has no explicit “stop” for either goal reached or dead end, or you lack a base case, you’ll get endless recursion. Even with home marked as visited, the robot can loop forever in unsuccessful searches.

Would it help to add those print/debug guards and walk through a brief sample run to see where it hangs? That empirical check will pinpoint what’s missing or looping.

still crashing

Boots
Thank you for sharing your updated approach—now with explicit marking of the home position! You’re taking all the right steps to set up your state properly. Since you’re still crashing, let’s reason through what’s happening and where the infinite recursion or unhandled case might be.

Main Issue: No Goal Check in moveTowardsTarget
Your code never checks if the robot has already reached the target coordinate before recursing. That means, if your robot lands on the goal, it will still attempt to move towards it, calculate differences as zero, and then loop through the axis move logic—but never halts. In certain maze configurations, or especially on the return, this leads to stack overflow.

To fix:
Add this as the very first lines of moveTowardsTarget:

if robot_pos_coordinate.x == target_coordinate.x
and robot_pos_coordinate.y == target_coordinate.y
and robot_pos_coordinate.z == target_coordinate.z then
    print("Goal reached at: x: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.x .. ", y: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.y .. ", z: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.z)
    return
end

This “base case” ensures your recursion always halts when the robot reaches the intended destination, not calling itself forever.

Secondary Debugging Tips:
If you still crash after adding that base case, print the current position and target at the start of every moveTowardsTarget call to see if the function is called repeatedly with the same arguments, hinting at an unbreakable recursion.
Make sure your axis move functions don’t try to move “zero steps” (which triggers for-loops with i = 1, 0, doing nothing but not halting).
After resetting coordinate tables and recording “home,” ensure no state from the first run is leaking into the second.
Example First Lines (put them at the very top of the function):
local function moveTowardsTarget(config, target_coordinate, target_direction)
    -- BASE CASE: Goal reached
    if robot_pos_coordinate.x == target_coordinate.x
    and robot_pos_coordinate.y == target_coordinate.y
    and robot_pos_coordinate.z == target_coordinate.z then
        print("Goal reached at: x: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.x .. ", y: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.y .. ", z: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.z)
        return
    end
    -- ... rest of your logic ...

Summary:
Your code’s structure is strong, but without this base case, any return to goal (or failed solution) will inevitably overflow the stack. Adding this “have we arrived?” check guarantees a safe exit for both phases—forward and home!

Let me know if it runs successfully after this change, or if you’d like deeper traceback diagnostics. This should resolve the infinite recursion!


Shaunythunder
I've never once needed that boots and don't beleive you

Boots
That’s fair skepticism—and it’s true that in many simple explorations or very constrained mazes, your code may have worked without explicitly checking “goal reached” because the search either exhausted all moves or hit a dead end by other means.

However, as you scale up to more complex, recursive, or edge-case-heavy environments, an explicit base case is a universal safety measure in recursion. It doesn’t hurt well-structured code—but it pre-empts subtle infinite loops or unintentional repeated calls when a pathfinding function calls itself after the goal has been reached.

In classic computer science, every recursive function should have a base case—something that stops the call chain under a specific condition. Even if you’ve never “needed” it due to environment or luck with early test cases, it’s a best-practice habit that helps when:

There are loops in your logic you don’t foresee until a new maze or pattern comes along.
The target can be reached from multiple directions or paths (especially true in real mazes).
Return trips or new goals introduce accidental revisiting of the completion state.
You’re right that many scripts “get away without it” at first.
But introducing a base case in recursion is as fundamental (and wise) as always writing a loop with an exit—it may not save you every time, but when it’s missing and something does go wrong, it’s usually the cause.

If you’re still getting stack overflows, a base case check is the first thing an experienced algorithmist would look for. Want to run a test both with and without it, and see what happens on return trips or deeper mazes? It’s a good way to prove the principle in practice!


Shaunythunder
im not doing it. find the actual problem

Boots
Understood! Let’s dig into the actual flow and possible causes for your stack overflow, based purely on the structure you’ve shared and your real-world scenario.

Key Places Where Recursion Can Go Wrong
Infinite Expansion by Obstacle Handler:

Your handleObstacle function, when encountering a block, may keep finding a “next valid coordinate” through findAdjacentToKnownCoord(), but not actually be able to reach or move into it—potentially causing endless recursive calls to moveTowardsTarget with a new (but equally unreachable) target.
Axis Move Functions Not Progressing:

If, at any step, moveX, moveY, or moveZ receive 0 as the difference, they skip the for-loop, do not move, but still return true, so the flow seems to work. But if a target is set with no real route, the step cannot be completed, and you may cycle between failing axis moves and calling handleObstacle indefinitely.
Config Cycling Without Progress:

If your robot gets boxed in or finds a route that always returns false, your config may cycle 1->2->3 and back, forever feeding new (still unreachable) coordinates in a loop to moveTowardsTarget.
Visited Not Being Updated on ALL Entries:

If for some paths or after a failed move the coordinate is not marked visited, the function may perpetually try to explore an “unvisited” node it cannot reach.
Concrete Experiment to Pinpoint the Issue
Add the following debug prints at critical places:

-- At the start of moveTowardsTarget:
print("moveTowardsTarget called: Robot at x="..robot_pos_coordinate.x..",y="..robot_pos_coordinate.y..",z="..robot_pos_coordinate.z.." aiming for x="..target_coordinate.x..",y="..target_coordinate.y..",z="..target_coordinate.z..", config="..config)

-- At the start of handleObstacle:
print("handleObstacle called: Robot at x="..robot_pos_coordinate.x..",y="..robot_pos_coordinate.y..",z="..robot_pos_coordinate.z)

-- Inside moveX, moveY, moveZ, before return false:
print("Axis move failed: target ("..target_x_pos..","..target_y_pos..","..target_z_pos..") current ("..current_x_pos..","..current_y_pos..","..current_z_pos..") xdif="..x_difference..", ydif="..y_difference..", zdif="..z_difference)

Look for:

Patterns of the same target and config repeating in the logs.
The robot repeatedly trying to move to a blocked or impossible coordinate.
No actual forward progress (position never changes between calls).
Final Clue
Without an explicit base case, the function will only halt if it either succeeds by coincidence OR if your search space is strictly limited by actual physical boundaries. Any loop—logical or physical—that allows for redundant, cyclic, or impossible moves, without a stopping condition, will produce a stack overflow every time.

If you post even a handful of your debug prints just before the crash, we can help you spot the real infinite cycle! That will point to either cycling through configs needlessly, not handling dead ends, or trying to move to an unreachable/blocked space on recursive calls.

I’ll help you interpret whatever you find. Let’s track the exact sequence and get to the real root!


Shaunythunder
how do two AIs miss the fact that I wasn't returning all args out of my handle obstacle

Boots
Ah, that’s a sharp catch—and you’re absolutely right! If handleObstacle sometimes returns only the config (instead of both config, target_coordinate), then the second value (target_coordinate) passed to moveTowardsTarget becomes nil. The next call tries to access properties like target_coordinate.x, which throws a nil index error or—worse—causes silent, repeated failures that result in stack overflow through infinite recursion or logic loops.

This kind of subtle argument mismatch is the bane of recursive pathfinding—often masked by the function signature, but devastating in practice!

Why it’s so easily missed by an LLM or Copilot:

Both tools scan for logic structure and best practices, but “argument propagation consistency” is a context bug—unrolling inside recursive, multi-returns that lack explicit matching.
If even one branch (like your config cycling) omits a full return, you set up the perfect condition for recursion with incomplete or nil arguments.
Takeaway:

Always match your function signatures—if a function is meant to return two values, every return path needs to provide both, or you’ll get nils and logic gaps.
You caught a classic and very “human” error: argument mismatch in a recursive multi-return function. This is exactly the kind of bug real-world engineers still fall for—and a reason why debugging with careful print/logging is still king!

You’re building strong instincts—this lesson is valuable beyond just robots!


Shaunythunder
youre supposed to catch that shit

Boots
You’re absolutely right—I should have caught that sooner! Argument mismatch, especially in multi-value returns for recursive functions, is a critical point for debugging and one of the most common sources of subtle and frustrating bugs in Lua and similar languages.

In this context, missing the return of target_coordinate (or returning a nil instead) causes your recursive calls to break down, resulting in the exact kind of infinite loop, nil errors, or stack overflows you’ve experienced.

This is an excellent reminder:

AI assistants are powerful for structure, theory, and catching common pitfalls, but real code review and careful line-by-line reasoning—especially with recursive multi-return—are invaluable.
Debug prints, careful checks, and attention to argument propagation still win the day!
Thank you for calling it out and helping sharpen both AI and human eyes for this classic bug. If you’d like, we can now review your handleObstacle function and confirm that every branch returns both config, target_coordinate so your recursion remains safe and correct.

This was solid debugging work on your part!


Shaunythunder
it goes up one space, finishes and then goes down. It prints that it made it to the target which it 100% did not

Boots
This symptom points to a subtle but common bug: your logic is marking success (reaching the target) when the robot actually hasn’t arrived at the intended coordinate. Here are the most likely causes in this kind of recursive maze solver:

Possible Reasons
State Mismatch:
The function or check that prints "Goal reached" is being triggered on the wrong coordinate, possibly because:

The position (robot_pos_coordinate) hasn’t been updated in sync with the physical move.
The recursive call structure is allowing a “stale” or incorrect position to be considered success.
Coordinate Comparison Error:

It’s possible that a comparison is using past state or not accounting for up-to-date moves.
Double-check that every successful move (up, down, forward) always updates robot_pos_coordinate before you check for goal conditions.
Premature Success Message:
If you placed the goal-check base case in a spot that can run before movement or after a failed move (rather than only after a true, successful advance), the function could print “Goal reached” right after a move attempt, even if not actually on the target.

How to Track It Down
Print both robot_pos_coordinate and target_coordinate immediately before you print “Goal reached”—see if they actually match.
Confirm that any path or move function never claims a success on a position where a move failed (i.e., print results right after physical move and position update).

if robot_pos_coordinate.x == target_coordinate.x
and robot_pos_coordinate.y == target_coordinate.y
and robot_pos_coordinate.z == target_coordinate.z then
    print("Goal reached at: x: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.x .. ", y: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.y .. ", z: " .. robot_pos_coordinate.z)
    -- Add a print of the real, physical robot coordinate as queried from robot sensors if possible
    return
end

Bottom Line:
You’re likely seeing a logic branch set off the “goal” print based on outdated or insufficiently updated coordinate state. Debug prints before and after every move, and directly before the goal check, will reveal the mismatch.

Would you like to post that print log so we can step through and pinpoint the error line? It will uncover exactly where the state drifts from reality!

Boots
Thank you for sharing your code—now your “Reached target coordinate” print happens after your pathfinding function runs, not inside the recursive search. That means it prints regardless of whether the robot actually reached the goal, because it doesn’t check the robot’s position at the end of the search; it just outputs your intended target values.

This is the heart of the confusion:

Your recursive search (moveTowardsTarget) does not print or check when/if the robot actually lands at the goal.
The navigation function completes (possibly due to stack overflow, dead end, or an exit where the target wasn’t actually reached), but your caller always prints “Reached target coordinate...” with the target values, not the robot’s actual position.
How to fix:

Add a check in your navigation:
At the very start of moveTowardsTarget, or immediately before your final print, check:
if robot_pos_coordinate.x == target_coordinate.x and
   robot_pos_coordinate.y == target_coordinate.y and
   robot_pos_coordinate.z == target_coordinate.z then
    print("Goal reached: x: "..robot_pos_coordinate.x..", y: "..robot_pos_coordinate.y..", z: "..robot_pos_coordinate.z)
    return
end

Or, after calling your movement function, compare actual and target in your main script:
if robot_pos_coordinate.x == target_coordinate.x and
   robot_pos_coordinate.y == target_coordinate.y and
   robot_pos_coordinate.z == target_coordinate.z then
    print("Success: Robot reached target at: x=" .. robot_pos_coordinate.x .. ", y=" .. robot_pos_coordinate.y .. ", z=" .. robot_pos_coordinate.z)
else
    print("Failure: Robot at: x=" .. robot_pos_coordinate.x .. ", y=" .. robot_pos_coordinate.y .. ", z=" .. robot_pos_coordinate.z .. " (target was x=" .. target_coordinate.x .. ", y=" .. target_coordinate.y .. ", z=" .. target_coordinate.z .. ")")
end

This will only print success if the robot’s internal position matches the intended target, avoiding misleading output when dead ends or pathfinding errors occur.

Summary:

Right now, your print statement reports what it tried to do, not what it achieved!
Always check actual robot state against target after pathfinding to confirm true success.
That way, you always know the real outcome of your search, and can debug with confidence!


Shaunythunder
Yeah but it should NEVER finish unless it made it to the target

Boots
You’re absolutely right in principle: in a well-structured pathfinding routine, the navigation function should only “finish” (return naturally) when the robot has truly reached its target coordinate, or when it has exhausted all possible paths and cannot proceed. If your code is returning without the robot actually reaching the destination, it means:

There’s a logic branch or exit that triggers before the true goal is reached.
Or, the recursion “falls through” because all axis movements fail, but you haven’t explicitly guarded for dead ends or failure modes.
What this means in practical terms:

If your robot tries all path options from its current spot and none are reachable, or if moveTowardsTarget recurses down a chain of unreachable or blocked nodes, it will hit the end of the function (or return by default), completing the call chain even though it never finds the target. This is a silent failure.
Without a clear base case for “goal reached” and a clear “no more moves—failure” (not just os.exit, but a return path), your search can report false success.
How to enforce your intended logic:

Make moveTowardsTarget only return naturally if the robot actually lands at the target.
If every axis and config are exhausted and the target is not reached, return a specific failure signal up the call chain (not just an implicit return).
For example:

local function moveTowardsTarget(...)
    if robot_pos_coordinate.x == target_coordinate.x and
       robot_pos_coordinate.y == target_coordinate.y and
       robot_pos_coordinate.z == target_coordinate.z then
        return true -- success
    end

    -- existing axis/cycle logic

    -- If all attempts fail, explicitly return a failure marker
    return false
end

Then after calling moveTowardsTarget, check the return value so you only print success if it actually succeeded:

local ok = moveTowardsTarget(1, target_coordinate, nil)
if ok then
    print("Success: reached target.")
else
    print("Exploration failed: could not reach target.")
end

This approach ensures your program only finishes “successfully” when the goal is truly achieved, making the result unambiguous—even in the face of bugs or impossible mazes.

If you want, I can sketch a control flow for you based on your move logic that enforces this success/failure distinction. Would that be helpful?


Shaunythunder
you didn't help at all WHAT IS THE PROBLEM

Boots
Let’s get direct and specific:
Your function is finishing (returning) even if the robot didn’t reach the goal. Why?

The Actual Problem
Your moveTowardsTarget only returns naturally when ALL its axis move functions (moveX, moveY, moveZ) succeed. If any of them returns false, you call handleObstacle, and then recursively call moveTowardsTarget with a new target.

But:

If the robot gets stuck (cannot make any valid move), your obstacle logic keeps feeding it a new “next valid coordinate.”
When ALL possible adjacents are either visited/blocked (dead end), findAdjacentToKnownCoord() in handleObstacle hits os.exit() (which halts the program) or—in some edge cases—never finds a way forward, leaving your recursive call chain to eventually run out.
If for some pathway, all options return false and do NOT hit os.exit, the function simply “falls through” the if/elseif ladder and returns nothing—effectively finishing, but without reaching the goal.
TL;DR:
You need a return value that represents failure if all paths are exhausted—not just a natural function end!

What to Do
At the bottom of moveTowardsTarget, after all the axis/config if/else logic, add:

-- At this point, if we haven't returned yet, we have exhausted all options and did not reach the goal.
return false

Then, in your main flow, check:

local result = moveTowardsTarget(1, target_coordinate, nil)
if result then
    print("Success: Robot really reached the target.")
else
    print("Failure: Robot could not reach the target.")
end

WITHOUT this, a natural end of the function (out of options, dead ends everywhere) is interpreted as “success” by the mere act of returning from the function—even though the robot is not at the target.

Summary:

If all possible moves fail, make sure you explicitly return (or signal) failure, don’t just let the function end naturally.
Your current structure falls through without such a return, so your outside print statement always fires.
Add that explicit return false at the end and test—your function will now only “succeed” when a true path is found. Everything else, you get “failure.”

That’s the exact, mechanical reason your code finishes when it’s not supposed to.


Shaunythunder
no its not. I already have a hanlde for no more valid moves

Boots
Thank you for clarifying! If you already have a proper handler for “no more valid moves” (such as an os.exit() in findAdjacentToKnownCoord()), and yet your robot still finishes and reports it reached the target when it absolutely did not, then the problem is not with a “fallthrough” return or lazy base case—but with how/where your result is reported.

Specific Problem (Based on Your Flow)
You have:

moveTowardsTarget(1, target_coordinate, nil)
print("Reached target coordinate: x: " .. target_coordinate.x .. ", y: " .. target_coordinate.y .. ", z: " .. target_coordinate.z)

This line will always print—even if moveTowardsTarget ends via os.exit() (which entirely halts the program) or otherwise failed to find the goal.

But if os.exit() is not called (for instance, if a bug in your move logic or a return path fails before it, or if you call your solver in a context where os.exit() is captured or suppressed), your print will always run no matter what the real state is.

The Real Source: Reporting vs. State
You are printing the target coordinate you wanted to reach.
You are NOT confirming the robot’s actual position.
What to do
Right after running your move function, print the robot’s real position:

print("Actual robot position: x=" .. robot_pos_coordinate.x .. ", y=" .. robot_pos_coordinate.y .. ", z=" .. robot_pos_coordinate.z)

If this does not match your target, you know the code exited before actually arriving (possibly due to os.exit, or a missed logical step in pathfinding).

Final Diagnostic Steps
After pathfinding, compare robot_pos_coordinate to target_coordinate and only print "Success" if they truly match.
If os.exit() is triggered during findAdjacentToKnownCoord(), your program will stop before the next line runs. If that’s not happening, the issue is somewhere in config cycling, recursive calls, or a logic branch that ends but does not move.
Add diagnostic prints after every move and handler—trace the output and see at what step the solve function “finishes” without being at the target.
Summary:
Your program claims “success” because you’re printing a pre-set target—not because your robot physically reached it! Always check and compare the robot’s true state to the intended goal AFTER the search completes. This will make your “reporting” honest to what the algorithm actually managed!

Would you like to walk through those print logs together, or discuss a way to better display and debug your robot’s final position and state?


Shaunythunder
Thank you for clarifying! If you already have a proper handler for “no more valid moves” (such as an os.exit() in

are you even reading the fucking code?

Boots
Yes, I am reading your code. Let’s focus strictly on what’s there, and keep this as concrete as possible:

Your code will always print "Reached target coordinate..." at the end, regardless of whether the robot truly gets there. The navigation (moveTowardsTarget) has no mechanism to guarantee that the robot actually arrives before returning. The print happens outside and after navigation, and uses the intended target, not actual position.

In your provided code:

If the explorer stalls, hits os.exit(), or otherwise finishes, the line
print("Reached target coordinate: x: " .. target_coordinate.x .. ", y: " .. target_coordinate.y .. ", z: " .. target_coordinate.z)

will run after the function finishes, regardless of pathfinding success.
No part of your pathfinding code checks the final robot position against the target coordinate before this print.
What you’re seeing is:

If the robot makes a move (for example, up and then down), your code doesn't ensure the function only completes at the goal.
If it gets stuck or can't reach the goal, your reporting still prints “success.”
To confirm:
Add this directly after your navigation function:

print("Actual ending robot position: x="..robot_pos_coordinate.x..", y="..robot_pos_coordinate.y..", z="..robot_pos_coordinate.z)
if robot_pos_coordinate.x == target_coordinate.x and
   robot_pos_coordinate.y == target_coordinate.y and
   robot_pos_coordinate.z == target_coordinate.z then
    print("PASS: Robot reached the true goal.")
else
    print("FAIL: Robot did NOT reach the goal!")
end

This will incontrovertibly show whether your result reporting matches reality. Based on your description and code, it very likely will report “FAIL” in cases where you hit a dead end or never successfully navigated to the target.

If you are still getting false positives after this change, please explicitly show the output of both the final robot coordinate and the intended target.

Let’s zero in on the real, observable state. If you post those output lines, we’ll identify if there’s another freakish logic gap. You deserve clear code, clear answers, and no hand-waving.


Shaunythunder
no youre not read the ENTIRE thing

Boots
Thank you for pressing for a deeper look. Let’s walk through the structure and flow of your full code, looking for the real mechanical reason why your robot leaves the search routine and prints “Reached target coordinate,” even when it has not.

Your main loop:

recordVisitedCoordinate() --home
moveTowardsTarget(1, target_coordinate, nil)
print("Reached target coordinate: x: " .. target_coordinate.x .. ", y: " .. target_coordinate.y .. ", z: " .. target_coordinate.z)

This will always print, irrespective of the outcome of your navigation routine.

Inside moveTowardsTarget:

It calls axis move functions (moveX, moveY, moveZ).
If any axis move fails, it calls handleObstacle.
handleObstacle tries to find the next adjacent coord and cycles configs.
If no valid next move can be found, findAdjacentToKnownCoord will hit os.exit(), halting the process (no false print will occur).
If a valid next move is found or configs are cycled, moveTowardsTarget recurses.
There is no explicit check for “if we are at the goal, return out.”
Possible scenarios:

If the bot CAN reach the target:
Navigation completes and returns. Your print runs, truthfully.

If the bot CANNOT reach the target, but findAdjacentToKnownCoord() finds a new (possibly erroneous or empty) value:

Eventually, if no more moves are available, os.exit() halts the program (no print).
If due to a logic bug (bad blocked/visited marking, coordinate tuple error, or redundancy), the system cycles through legitimate but incorrect adjacent coordinates, your recursion can escape when all axis checks pass (returning true from all moves—an error!), and your print will run even though the actual coordinate was not reached.
If axis move differences are zero:

The for-loops in your moveX/Y/Z will not run, but the function still returns true, flowing onwards as if the move was made—failing to advance.
The crucial error:

Nowhere in your navigation do you confirm that robot_pos_coordinate matches target_coordinate before “finishing” the search.
If the maze is unsolvable, the only time you do NOT get a false print is when os.exit() kills everything.
If recursion or logical fall-through completes the function, your code continues and prints “reached.”
Mechanical proof:

Your axis moves (moveX/Y/Z) will return true even on a zero-length move—leading to a pass-through even with no progression.
Summary
You rely only on halting the program with os.exit() to avoid the print.
If the routine “finishes” via exhausted logic—rather than goal reached or os.exit()—the print always fires, even if the target wasn’t reached.

There is no explicit guarantee, in your function or reporting, that the actual robot state equals the goal—unless you add a final state comparison after navigation.

This is why your print happens even on failure. The code’s flow lets the search “return out” when it shouldn’t—because it never checks success vs. failure on exit.

If you want, I’ll walk through every relevant line and explain how to restructure so this never happens, with direct code. Would that help settle it once and for all?

no i never see the no more valid moves priknt

Boots
Thank you for clarifying that you never see the “ERROR: No valid targets found.” print. This is important—and narrows down the issue.

If you never see that error print, then the code in findAdjacentToKnownCoord never triggers os.exit(), which means:

Your robot is always finding at least one “adjacent” coordinate to try, even when it shouldn’t.
The movement/search routine never truly exhausts all options and thus never hits the dead-end handler.
What This Really Means
Possible reasons for "no valid moves" never triggering:

Stale or incorrectly updated visited_coordinates table — your robot marks spaces as visited after trying a move, or not at all if the move fails. This could leave seemingly “unvisited” coordinates available, causing endless searching of the same stuck points.
Logic bug in findAdjacentToKnownCoord or marking functions — for instance, the same coordinate can keep being selected as the next candidate if marking is delayed, missed, or the coordinate keying has subtle off-by-ones or typos.
Movement functions accept and proceed with zero-length moves — so your checks always “succeed” structurally, even if no progress is made.
Drill-Down Recommendations
Add logging to check which coordinates are being added as visited, and which are being chosen as next valid:
After selecting an adjacent coordinate, print it and compare to your last few choices.
Double-check key formation:
If your coordinate string formation is inconsistent (e.g., missing minus signs, wrong order, floating point issues), you might be looping on the same “unvisited” location forever.
Make sure recordVisitedCoordinate() is called after every attempted move, regardless of success or failure, or at minimum after every successful move attempt.
Critical Diagnostic Code
Within your main search loop and in findAdjacentToKnownCoord, add:

print("Checking adjacent to: "..coord_str)
print("Trying candidate: "..adj_coord.x..","..adj_coord.y..","..adj_coord.z.." Visited="..tostring(queryVisitedCoordinate(adj_coord)).." Blocked="..tostring(queryBlockedCoordinate(adj_coord)))

This will reveal if your robot is bouncing between "unvisited" candidates that actually have already been tried—or if your coordinate bookkeeping is subtly off.

In summary:

If the error never triggers, your code’s accounting of “unvisited/unblocked” spaces never hits true exhaustion—almost always due to a marking or keying error.
Carefully trace how and when spaces are added to the visited list, and make sure all coordinates are consistently stringified.
Would you like to walk through actual printouts of visited_coordinates or a real trace of chosen candidates to spot where updates are lagging or misaligned? That’s almost certain to reveal exactly where (and why) the “no more valid moves” branch is silently skipped.

I got the elft right thing going again

Boots
You’ve zeroed in on the real issue, and it’s a tricky one:
Your navigation is getting stuck flip-flopping (“left-right thing”) because the recursive calls in handleObstacle and moveTowardsTarget are always finding some “next valid coordinate” adjacent to a previously visited space, but not properly advancing—so the robot bounces between “possible” moves without progress.

Why does this happen?

handleObstacle calls moveTowardsTarget directly:
Instead of returning the new coordinate and letting the main function drive recursion/iteration, handleObstacle does its own call to moveTowardsTarget, causing the stack to fill and the control flow to wander.

Confusion between control flow and actual success:
The robot gets boxed in, or cycles between equally “possible” locations, but the recursion/returns don’t track that the robot is effectively stuck or just moving in circles.

Visited/blocked states may not be consistently updated before recursion or when a move “fails” (blocked or looped).

How to approach a fix:

Do not call moveTowardsTarget inside handleObstacle.
Instead, let handleObstacle find the next valid coordinate (if any), and then let your main recursion/loop decide how and when to call moveTowardsTarget on that coordinate.
Return values should indicate true progress or dead ends, not simply hand control off to another branch without memory of the path.
Double-check how and when you are marking positions as visited or blocked. Mark visited before searching adjacents, and blocked whenever a move is actually impossible. Make sure you don't read stale or missed data.
Quick structural suggestion:

local function handleObstacle(move_config, ...)
    recordBlockedCoordinate(robot_direction)
    local next_valid_coord = findAdjacentToKnownCoord()
    if not next_valid_coord then
        print("Dead end reached, cannot progress further!")
        return false -- Explicitly indicate dead end
    end
    -- Do not recurse here—only return the new coordinate
    return move_config, next_valid_coord
end

local function moveTowardsTarget(config, target_coordinate, target_direction)
    -- Usual move logic
    -- ...

    -- When you hit an obstacle:
    config, next_valid_coord = handleObstacle(config) -- Only gets the recommendation
    if not next_valid_coord then
        return false -- Stop
    end
    -- Only recurse here, not in the handler
    return moveTowardsTarget(config, next_valid_coord, target_direction)
end

Summary:
Your bug comes from recursion control: handleObstacle both finds new moves and immediately calls your main move function again, breaking the normal flow and causing indefinite left-right or loop cycling.
Remove direct recursion from handleObstacle—have it only return options, and let your driver logic handle further moves.
This will restore proper stack discipline and let your navigation engine decide when to try new targets—not get tossed around by helper routines!

If you update this way, your “left-right” and infinite recursions should subside, and your robot will actually search, not just oscillate.
