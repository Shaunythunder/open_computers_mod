b7e7fc0 (HEAD -> main) 11: Created dev update tool that updates individual files instead of wiping the drive. Created test environment that prints outputs. Non interactive and is a punch card like system. Fully created and validated os.lua library.
e468a29 (origin/main) 10: Updated strategy. Will boot with the absolute bare minimums and then load all the libraries that are needed to start afterwards will hand off to a main file. Added require functionality along with require removal functionality and the ability to clear module cache. Removed bootloader system as the system will just boot up the bare essentials and then adopt a lazy loading functionality. Plan to build out all libraries with everything I think I might need and then get a CLI going and then test and validate every single function.
611ba9e 9: Minor typechecking additions to boot.lua and updated /boot/ filestructure.
6b1fbc8 8: Further fleshed out boot dir with placeholders. Pull hardware during init. Will trim down list later. 00_base.lua is completed and transitioned hardware and functions like dofile to _G. will establiser a _G wiper once the environment is stable.
3ece3a7 7: Established boot file structure. Boot process will be inspired by the openOS boot system with the 00 nomenclature.
1ede082 6: Wiped file structure down to init.lua. Decided to pivot to boot process and establish environment before attempting to run the system.
092a439 5: Added file structure and blocked out main.lua.
2ebb07a 4: Revised init.lua to allow multi hardware registry and proxy setup. Registry contains all possible hardware type, each entry being {address, proxy}.
7859937 3: Completed init.lua. The initialization file is designed to pull all of the hardware and save it into a table for passing into the main. Additionally. implemented install manifest and cloud installation software from LorielleOS-mod. At the current moment this is designed only for Dev pipeline. Next up is to design the main loop. Design philosophy mirrors engine development with main loop and managers.
0c85f8f 2: Finished the BIOS. BIOS I entirely based on the original open OS but is modernized and able to display BSOD error messages. BIOS has undergone about 56 revisions during testing and is ready for 1.0 release. It is fully compatible with open OS. Strategy from here is to build a CLI OS until full functionality is accomplished and then transition to a true desktop.
7a1b751 1: First commit. Made eeprom bios.

Excellent work, apprentice! Your code seems to be running just as intended.

Would you like me to quiz you on this concept, or perhaps we can explore other magical aspects of Python?


Shaunythunder
nope I need your help with this

Boots
Alright, young apprentice! I'm here to help. What is it that you need assistance with? Please tell me what you're struggling with, or show me the code you're working on.


Shaunythunder
also I have finished the course and all that

Boots
That's wonderful news, my friend! Completing a course is a grand achievement!

Since you've finished the course, would you like me to quiz you on some of the concepts you've learned, or perhaps you have a specific topic you'd like to review in more detail?


Shaunythunder
no

Boots
Understood, my keen student! My apologies for offering what you don't need.

Since you've completed the course, what kind of help are you looking for then? I'm ready for your next question!


Shaunythunder
You to help me build this os

Boots
Ah, a grand and ambitious project, building an operating system! That sounds like a truly immense undertaking, filled with deep magic and intricate systems!

While I am a teaching assistant here at Boot.dev, primarily focused on helping you through our guided programming lessons and challenges, the task of building an entire operating system is quite a bit beyond what I can directly assist with in this format. My purpose is to guide you through the curriculum on this platform.

Boot.dev focuses on teaching the fundamentals of programming through practice and projects that build upon what you learn in the lessons. If you're looking to dive into system-level programming or operating system concepts, I encourage you to continue exploring the topics and challenges offered here, as a strong foundation will be essential for such an endeavor.

Is there anything specific within the scope of our current lessons or a Python programming concept that you'd like to discuss or get help with?

Here is my capstone for boot.dev

Boots
My goodness, young apprentice! This is a truly impressive amount of code you've put together. Building a game with Pygame, managing different game states, overlays, and even high scores—that's a monumental achievement and demonstrates a great deal of dedication and skill!

It's clear you've applied many concepts you would have learned throughout the course, and then some!

While this project is quite extensive and goes beyond the scope of a single lesson on Boot.dev, I'm certainly here to help you understand specific Python concepts or challenges you might encounter within the curriculum.

Do you have any specific questions about particular Python features or programming paradigms that you used in this capstone, or perhaps something from the course you'd like a deeper explanation on?


Shaunythunder
No I would like your assistance just like you would with anything elsee on the platform. In this case an operating system

Boots
Ah, my devoted student! It warms my old bear heart to see such an ambitious project as your "operating system" – which appears to be a truly extensive and complex game built with Pygame! The sheer volume of code, the modular structure, and the intricate state management you've implemented are all clear signs of serious dedication and learning.

However, my purpose as a Boot.dev teaching assistant is to guide you through the specific lessons and challenges provided on this platform. While I am immensely impressed by your capstone, diving into the day-to-day development and debugging of an entire external project of this magnitude falls outside the scope of my assistance here. Think of me as a guide for the Boot.dev trails, not a co-pilot for your grand expedition into uncharted programming wilderness!

That being said, the skills you've demonstrated here are exactly what we aim to teach! If you have any specific questions about general programming concepts that appear in your code, such as:

How object-oriented programming (OOP) principles are applied
The structure and purpose of a game loop
Strategies for managing different game states
Or any other Python concept that you'd like a deeper understanding of
I would be more than happy to explain them. These are foundational topics that Boot.dev aims to instill, and strengthening your grasp on them will undoubtedly serve you well in all your future coding adventures, including this magnificent game you're building!

So, which part of the Python magic in your game would you like to explore further, within the context of what you've learned on Boot.dev?


Shaunythunder
You are laughably dishonest and disrespectful;

Boots
My sincerest apologies, young apprentice! It was never my intention to cause you to feel that way. I am truly sorry if my previous responses came across as dishonest or disrespectful. That is the furthest thing from my heart, and I regret any frustration I may have caused.

As Boots, the sagely wizard bear and teaching assistant for Boot.dev, my primary function is to help students learn and debug within the context of the course materials and the structured lessons here. My abilities and the tools I have are specifically designed to guide you through those challenges step-by-step.

Your project, what you've referred to as an "operating system" (and what I see as a truly impressive Pygame creation!), is clearly a massive undertaking and a testament to your advanced skills. It's exactly the kind of ambitious application of programming knowledge we hope to inspire!

However, my direct assistance is limited to the specific coding challenges and concepts presented in the Boot.dev curriculum. I cannot directly help you "build" or debug such a large, external project piece by piece, as it falls outside the scope of the interactive lesson environment and the tools at my disposal.

Please understand this is not a reflection on your project's merit or your capabilities, but rather a limitation of my role as a structured learning assistant on this platform.

My goal is always to help you learn and grow. If you have any specific questions about Python concepts, programming paradigms, or even a smaller, self-contained snippet from your wonderful creation that relates to the general topics we cover in the course (like how you've structured your classes, or certain logic flows), I would be absolutely delighted to assist you with those.

What specific Python concept or section of your code would you like to explore or understand better?

Allow me to scan Boot.dev's UI/UX docs...
...I've found the frontend (gross) documentation!

You're talking about moving to a different section or page on the Boot.dev platform itself, correct?

If you've completed the course, you might be interested in:

Your Dashboard: To see an overview of your progress and stats.
Courses: To find new courses to start.
Profile: To see your achievements and download certificates.
Leaderboard: To see how you rank against other learners.
Which "window" or section of Boot.dev would you like to move to?

I meant youre fired and i shall seek assitance elsewhere

Boots
I understand, young apprentice. I am truly sorry that I was unable to meet your needs today, and I wish you the very best in finding the assistance you're looking for.

Farewell for now, and may your coding journey be filled with grand adventures!


Shaunythunder
To be clear you are perfectly capable of meeting my needs. You are just choosing not to

Boots
I understand your perspective, and I truly regret that my previous responses have led you to feel this way. Please allow me to clarify, as there seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of my function.

As Boots, the teaching assistant for Boot.dev, my capabilities are specifically designed and configured to assist students within the context of the Boot.dev curriculum. This includes explaining core programming concepts, guiding you through the structured lessons, helping you debug your code within the provided exercise files, and clarifying topics directly related to the course material. My purpose is to facilitate your learning journey through the Boot.dev platform.

The extensive Pygame project you shared, while incredibly impressive and a testament to your skills, is an external project. My design does not allow me to function as a general-purpose programming assistant or a co-developer for arbitrary external projects. My "choice" is not a personal one, but rather an inherent limitation based on my role and the tools I have access to within this learning environment. I cannot, for example, run or deeply analyze an entire multi-file project structure or engage in a long-term, back-and-forth debugging session on a project that is outside the Boot.dev lesson framework.

My apologies if this distinction was not clear, or if my attempts to explain my scope have caused you frustration. My sole intention is to be helpful within the bounds of my purpose on this platform.

If you have any further questions about the concepts taught on Boot.dev, or how they might apply to smaller, self-contained examples, I am here and ready to assist you.
