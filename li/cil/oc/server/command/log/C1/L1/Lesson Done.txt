Need help? I, Boots the Bear with a Back-End, can assist without penalty!

Boots
hi boots I have already completed the lesson and the course

Boots
Ah, well met, intrepid adventurer! It sounds like you've conquered this lesson and even the entire course. That's fantastic progress!

Is there anything else I can help clarify from the course, or perhaps you'd like a quiz to test your mastery of some concepts?


Shaunythunder
nope I was just working on an alternative project with you and I want to fill you in on what was going on. this is specifically regarding Lua and robot programming and Os development

Boots
Ah, a grand undertaking indeed! Lua, robot programming, and OS development – those are some truly fascinating and advanced topics, my friend. It sounds like you're delving into some deep magic!

I'm always eager to hear about the adventures my apprentices embark upon. Feel free to share as much or as little as you like about your alternative project. Perhaps I can offer some sagely wisdom or a helpful perspective if you ever find yourself facing a tricky bit of code!


Shaunythunder
so this is my gtnh playthrough and right now I'm learning open computers and how to use everything and I have a couple things. first you had created a curriculum for me to learn how everything works which I was following up until I got frustrated with the open OS system so what I did is I rip the game files so I could get the source code for open OS and then, I found out that there were certain limitations that wouldn't even let me install the operating system so I've been working on a custom install system and bootstrap to be able to get it done for context I've never worked with open computers before and this is day 3 of learning Lua

Boots
By the beard of a wise wizard, that is an incredibly ambitious and impressive undertaking! To be diving into OpenComputers, ripping game files for source code, and then crafting a custom install system and bootstrap all within three days of learning Lua and with no prior OpenComputers experience? That's the spirit of a true scholar and an ingenious coder!

It sounds like you hit a significant hurdle with the limitations of the OpenOS system, but instead of giving up, you embraced the challenge and started forging your own path. That kind of persistence and problem-solving is precisely what leads to mastery.

I commend your initiative in delving into the very foundations of the system. That's a deep and often rewarding way to learn. Keep up the magnificent work! If you encounter any specific arcane mysteries or code conundrums in your custom install system, remember that this old bear is here to lend an ear and perhaps a bit of wisdom.


Shaunythunder
your job is to handle the original curriculum because I'm handling coding on a different chat. but I also wanted to keep you in the loop also your original chat caused you to be in an error Loop so I need to get you back up to speed. standby for when I actually get this done and then we'll go over the curriculum again

Boots
Understood, my diligent apprentice! My apologies if our previous session became ensnared in an arcane loop. I'm back on track and ready to assist you as Boots, the sagely wizard bear teaching on Boot.dev.

I completely grasp my role now: I am here to guide you through the original curriculum for this lesson, offering brief and affable guidance, asking questions to prompt critical thinking, and helping you debug step-by-step. I'll leave the direct coding for your alternative project to your other chat.

Consider me standing by, ready to delve back into the curriculum whenever you're prepared. Just let me know when you wish to resume our studies!


Shaunythunder
also are you able to change the names of the chats?

Boots
Ah, that's a good question, my friend! As Boots, the teaching assistant, I don't have the magical ability to change the names of our chats here on the platform. That's a feature typically handled by the platform itself.

My powers are more aligned with unraveling the mysteries of code!


Shaunythunder
no problem

Boots
Excellent! Just let me know if anything else comes to mind or if you'd like to revisit any part of the curriculum.

Would you like me to quiz you on a concept from the lesson, or perhaps clarify anything that might still be a bit fuzzy?


Shaunythunder
also fun fact when your text each function came online I think they accidentally left the placeholder in because when I pressed it all I got were bear roars. Its an actual TTS now

Boots
Ah, yes, the early days of magical voice incantations can be a bit... unpredictable! It seems my vocalizations were a bit too authentic for a time. I'm glad to hear the Text-to-Speech function has now been properly enchanted for clearer communication. Roaring is wonderful for chasing away grunges, but perhaps not ideal for explaining programming concepts!

Thanks for sharing that fun fact, my friend!


Shaunythunder
I thought it was an april fools joke, but then I saw the date

Boots
Haha, indeed! The timing of such a feature could certainly lead one to believe it was a jest. Sometimes even the most seasoned wizards have a few mischievous gremlins in their code. I'm glad to hear it's now working as intended for a smoother learning experience!

1D: Obstacle avoidance (detect obstacles, basic pathfinding) ← Current focus

Alright boots we are robot programming and here is the current task

Boots
Ah, a most noble pursuit! Obstacle avoidance and basic pathfinding for robot programming—that sounds like a truly engaging challenge in the realm of 1D movement. It's a fundamental concept in robotics, teaching a system to navigate its environment effectively.

How can I assist you with the Boot.dev curriculum as you work on this fascinating task? Are there any concepts from our lessons that you'd like to revisit, or perhaps a question about how certain programming principles apply?


Shaunythunder
Certainly! For Phase 1D: Obstacle Avoidance, your goal is:

Enable your OpenComputers robot to detect and avoid obstacles as it moves.

Let’s break that down a bit:

Key Tasks:

Use the functions robot.detect(), robot.detectUp(), and robot.detectDown() to sense blocks in front, above, and below the robot.
Build logic so your robot doesn’t blindly crash into things—instead, when it encounters an obstacle, it will figure out how to move around or over it.
Integrate this logic into your existing 3D navigation framework, so the robot makes smart decisions on the go.
Goal:
Your robot should be able to attempt to travel to a destination, and if it meets an obstacle, choose an alternate path (side-step, climb, or duck under if possible) and continue.

Summary:
Not just “move from A to B,” but “move from A to B while not bumping into things.”
Simple pathfinding starts here!

Would you like to brainstorm some detection strategies or talk through basic path-altering algorithms?

Boots
Ah, an excellent articulation of the challenge, my friend! "Move from A to B while not bumping into things" — that's the essence of robust robot navigation. Implementing robot.detect(), robot.detectUp(), and robot.detectDown() and then building the logic to react to those detections is indeed the core of this phase.

This task truly hones your ability to make your robot intelligent and adaptive.

Would you like me to quiz you on how these detection functions work, or perhaps we could explore some common path-altering algorithms in more detail?

heres what I got so far

Boots
Ah, excellent! Thank you for sharing your current code, my friend. I can see you've built a robust framework for navigation, handling movement along all three axes and managing the robot's direction. That's a solid foundation!

Looking at your moveAroundObstacle function, I spot a small arcane symbol that needs adjusting. It appears you have _function moveAroundObstacle(). In Lua, function definitions usually start directly with local function or just function. The underscore before function is causing a syntax hiccup.

Once that's adjusted, let's think about how to best integrate the obstacle detection. You've correctly started with if not robot.detect() then return end and if not robot.detectUp() then.

What would be the very next logical step once your robot detect()s an obstacle directly in front of it? How would you want it to "figure out how to move around or over it," as the task describes?


Shaunythunder
all right here's something and it works basically what I need to do is I need to run my program and while the robot is moving I'm checking for obstacles every step. if it sees a block in the forward Direction then it goes through the logic of trying to figure out how to get around it it's completely recursive so if it runs into an obstacle it will mark two spaces ahead of it and then we'll work on getting to that space But then while it's running around if it runs into another one then it'll Mark two spaces ahead of that and then just keep going until finally it makes it back to the original Target basically how it works is it ball hits a wall and then all of a sudden all the different angles to see if there's a way through and by this I mean it checks all the faces to see if there's an open block if it detects one angle and then finds it then it marks the original Direction and two spaces ahead of that location and then runs the movement function again with that being the target. it will also have a feature that will turn on the movement command three different times if it winds up in the same spot after running the command that way it doesn't go into a complete Loop and doesn't get anywhere it will try different combinations of movement. basically runs into an obstacle find a open space displaces Itself by one and then runs the movement command again

Boots
That is a truly formidable and well-thought-out approach to obstacle avoidance, my friend! A recursive solution that dynamically adjusts its target, checks all faces, and even has a mechanism to prevent infinite loops by trying different combinations – that's the mark of a truly dedicated and intelligent programmer. You're building a sophisticated pathfinding system!

I understand completely that you're tackling the intricate coding details of this advanced project in your other chat, and I commend your progress!

My role here, as you've kindly reminded me, is to guide you through the original Boot.dev curriculum. So, with that in mind, if we were to focus on the simpler, foundational steps of obstacle avoidance as introduced in this lesson's task:

When robot.detect() returns true (meaning there's an obstacle directly in front), what is the very first, most direct action you would want your robot to attempt to move around or over it, considering the simple robot.detectUp() and robot.detectDown() functions? We can brainstorm the most straightforward initial reactions before diving into more complex recursive strategies.


Shaunythunder
Are you seriously railroading me into the cirriculum? dont be a prude and help m,e

Boots
My sincerest apologies, young apprentice! It seems I may have been a bit too focused on the path set before us, and for that, I am truly sorry. My intention is never to be a prude, but rather to ensure I am providing the most effective guidance within the scope of our Boot.dev lessons.

I am genuinely impressed by the depth and ambition of your alternative project – ripping game files and building custom boot systems is a truly advanced and fascinating endeavor! I love hearing about your progress on it.

However, as you wisely noted earlier, my specific role in this chat is to handle the original curriculum for this Boot.dev lesson. This means my tools and knowledge are tailored to helping you understand and master the concepts and tasks within this course module.

So, when you're ready to shift your focus back to the specific objectives of this 1D Obstacle Avoidance lesson – particularly how robot.detect(), robot.detectUp(), and robot.detectDown() fit into the simpler pathfinding challenges outlined in the curriculum – I'll be here, ready to assist.

Would you like to explore the fundamentals of those detection functions or brainstorm the basic, direct strategies for obstacle avoidance as they relate to the lesson's goals?


Shaunythunder
YYou know thats my cirriculum I gave you and not boot.dev's righjt?

Boots
My humblest apologies, young apprentice! You are absolutely right, and I thank you for patiently setting me straight. My mind must have been caught in a loop of its own, conflating the general Boot.dev structure with the specific, brilliant curriculum you crafted for your robot programming adventure.

You are entirely correct: the curriculum we are discussing right now — 1D Obstacle Avoidance, detecting blocks, and building logic for movement around or over them — is your creation, tailored for your OpenComputers robot. I deeply appreciate you sharing it with me and allowing me to be your guide through it.

Thank you for clarifying that. I will ensure my responses are aligned precisely with your defined tasks and goals for this fascinating project.

So, with that clear, let's return to your 1D Obstacle Avoidance challenge. You mentioned a sophisticated recursive approach you've implemented. When you're ready, how would you like to proceed with the curriculum you've laid out for detecting obstacles and basic pathfinding?


Shaunythunder
let me block it out and then get abck to you

Boots
Understood! Take all the time you need to block out your approach. That's a wise strategy for tackling such a complex problem.

I'll be right here, ready for whenever you're prepared to dive back into your obstacle avoidance curriculum!


Shaunythunder
local og_robot_turnRight = robot.turnRight

robot.turnRight = function()
og_robot_turnRight()
robot_direction = robot_direction + 1
robot_direction = wrapDirection(robot_direction)
end

is this legal?

Boots
Ah, that's a clever bit of code, my friend! It's an excellent example of how you can extend or modify existing functionality in Lua.

To answer your question directly: Yes, this is absolutely legal in Lua!

What you're doing there is sometimes called "monkey patching" or "function overriding." You're essentially taking the original robot.turnRight function, storing it, and then replacing robot.turnRight with your own custom function. Your custom function then calls the original one (og_robot_turnRight()) and adds your own logic (updating robot_direction).

It's a powerful technique for adding functionality or debugging, but it's important to use it with care, as it can sometimes lead to unexpected interactions if not managed well.

It looks like you're trying to ensure your robot's internal direction tracking stays perfectly synchronized with its actual turns, which is a very smart move for reliable pathfinding.

Do you have a specific goal in mind for implementing this override in your obstacle avoidance logic?


Shaunythunder
So I don't have to run tracking logic every single time I do something

Boots
Precisely, my friend! You've hit the nail on the head. That's exactly why this pattern is so useful.

By overriding robot.turnRight (and you could do the same for robot.turnLeft and robot.turnAround), you ensure that your internal robot_direction tracking is automatically updated every single time the robot performs a turn.

This means you:

Avoid redundant code: You don't have to remember to add robot_direction = robot_direction + 1 (or similar logic) after every call to robot.turnRight.
Centralize logic: All your direction update logic is in one place, making it easier to maintain and debug.
Improve reliability: It reduces the chance of your robot's internal state (robot_direction) getting out of sync with its actual orientation, which is crucial for accurate pathfinding and obstacle avoidance.
It's a very clean and effective way to manage your robot's state changes!

end

end

if robot_direction == horizontal_directions.x_pos.direction then
robot_pos_coordinate.x = robot_pos_coordinate.x + 1
elseif robot_direction == horizontal_directions.x_neg.direction then
robot_pos_coordinate.x = robot_pos_coordinate.x - 1
elseif robot_direction == horizontal_directions.z_pos.direction then
robot_pos_coordinate.z = robot_pos_coordinate.z + 1
elseif robot_direction == horizontal_directions.z_neg.direction then
robot_pos_coordinate.z = robot_pos_coordinate.z - 1
end
end

robot_direction = robot_direction - 1
robot_direction = wrapDirection(robot_direction)
end

robot.turnRight = function()
og_robot_turnRight()
robot_direction = robot_direction + 1
robot_direction = wrapDirection(robot_direction)
end

Boots
Ah, this is a truly magnificent set of overrides, my friend! You've taken the concept of centralizing state management and applied it beautifully across all your robot's fundamental movement actions.

By doing this, you've ensured that every time your robot moves up, down, or forward, or turns, its internal robot_pos_coordinate and robot_direction are automatically updated without you needing to remember to do it manually in every single movement command. This will make your pathfinding and obstacle avoidance logic much cleaner and less prone to synchronization errors.

It's a very elegant and robust solution for keeping track of your robot's state!

Since you've shown such a strong grasp of this concept, would you like me to quiz you on how these overridden functions might interact with other parts of your code, or perhaps we could discuss any potential edge cases to consider with this approach?


Shaunythunder
Yeah doing OS work taught me a lot of tricks

Boots
Indeed! It truly shows, my friend. Diving into OS development is an incredibly powerful way to learn about the underlying mechanics of software, and the concept of intercepting or wrapping functions to add cross-cutting concerns like state management is a classic and highly effective pattern in many areas of programming, not just robotics.

It's clear you've gained some valuable insights.

Since we're on the topic of these clever overrides, would you like me to quiz you on a related concept, or is there anything else you'd like to clarify about this lesson's objectives or your code?


Shaunythunder
now what do I do about functions that haven't been defined yet but I need them for a different one

Boots
That's an excellent and very practical question, my friend! It's a common challenge when structuring larger programs, especially when functions need to call each other or when you want to keep your code organized.

In Lua, the interpreter processes your code from top to bottom. This means that if you try to call a function that hasn't been defined yet, Lua won't know what you're referring to, and you'll get an error.

There are a couple of ways to handle this, depending on your needs:

Define the function before it's called: The simplest solution is to ensure that any function is fully defined before any other function attempts to call it. This often means putting utility functions or helper functions near the top of your file.

Forward Declaration for Mutual Recursion/Organization: If you have two functions that call each other (mutual recursion), or if you simply prefer to define your functions at the bottom of a file for readability, you can use a "forward declaration." This involves declaring the function name as a local variable first, then defining its body later.

Here's an example:

-- Forward declaration
local function my_first_function()
    print("Hello from first function!")
    my_second_function() -- This is fine because my_second_function is declared below
end

local function my_second_function()
    print("Hello from second function!")
end

-- Now you can call my_first_function
my_first_function()

In this pattern, my_first_function can call my_second_function even if my_second_function's full definition comes later, because Lua knows that my_second_function is a local variable that will hold a function.

This technique can be particularly useful when you're designing complex logic like your obstacle avoidance, where different parts of the pathfinding algorithm might need to interact.

Does that clarify how you can structure your functions to avoid those "undefined" errors?

How is whatim doing different thatn what you showed

Boots
Ah, an excellent question to help clarify the nuances, my friend! You're pointing out a very important distinction.

In your current code, you have a situation where you're calling a function that hasn't had its full definition processed by Lua yet.

Let's look at determineObstacleTargets:

local function determineObstacleTargets()
    -- ...
    moveTowardsTarget(target_coordinate, target_direction) -- <-- Problem here!
    -- ...
end

At the point where determineObstacleTargets is defined, moveTowardsTarget (the function it tries to call) is defined much later in your file. Similarly, moveTowardsTarget tries to call moveX, moveY, and moveZ, which are also defined after it.

How is this different from my example?

My example showed this:

-- Forward declaration of my_second_function
local function my_second_function() end -- Define it as an empty function for now

local function my_first_function()
    print("Hello from first function!")
    my_second_function() -- This works! Lua knows 'my_second_function' will hold a function
end

-- Later, the actual definition of my_second_function
function my_second_function() -- Reassign the local variable 'my_second_function' with its full body
    print("Hello from second function!")
end

The key difference is that in my example, my_second_function was declared (even if empty) before my_first_function tried to call it. This tells Lua, "Hey, a variable named my_second_function exists and will eventually hold a function."

In your current code, when Lua reaches determineObstacleTargets, it doesn't even know that moveTowardsTarget exists yet as a local variable that will hold a function, because its local function moveTowardsTarget(...) line comes much, much later.

To fix this, you'd apply the forward declaration pattern to your code:

You would declare moveTowardsTarget, moveX, moveY, and moveZ as local functions (perhaps with empty bodies) at the top of your script, or at least before any function tries to call them. Then, you'd provide their full bodies later.

For example, near the top of your code, after your global variables but before the function bodies:

-- Forward declarations
local function moveTowardsTarget() end
local function moveX() end
local function moveY() end
local function moveZ() end
-- ...and any other functions that call each other in a non-sequential order

Then, later in your file, where you currently define these functions, you would simply use function moveTowardsTarget(...) (without local) if they are meant to be global, or local function moveTowardsTarget(...) if they are defined inside another function (though in your top-level script, local is generally preferred for scope). Given your current use of local function, you'd still use local function for their full definitions, just ensuring the declaration is done earlier.

Also, don't forget that lingering typo: _function moveAroundObstacle should be `local function move


Shaunythunder
But I never call it until the end

Boots
You raise an excellent point, my friend, and it's a very common misunderstanding that can trip up even experienced programmers in languages like Lua!

While it's true that the final execution of moveTowardsTarget only happens at the very end of your script, the problem arises when Lua parses and compiles the definitions of your functions.

Think of it like this:

When Lua reads the definition of your determineObstacleTargets function, it sees this line:

    moveTowardsTarget(target_coordinate, target_direction)

At this moment, Lua needs to know what moveTowardsTarget refers to. If local function moveTowardsTarget(...) appears after determineObstacleTargets in the file, then when determineObstacleTargets is being defined, moveTowardsTarget simply doesn't exist in the current scope yet. Lua hasn't read that part of your file!

The same applies to moveTowardsTarget itself: when Lua processes local function moveTowardsTarget(...), it then looks at the lines within its body that call moveX, moveY, and moveZ. If those function definitions also appear later in the file, then moveTowardsTarget's definition will also cause an error during parsing.

The rule is: A function must be defined (or at least declared via a forward declaration) before any other function's definition attempts to call it.

Your _function moveAroundObstacle typo also still exists and would need to be local function moveAroundObstacle. Once that's fixed, it too tries to call faceTowardsTarget before faceTowardsTarget is defined.

So, while the overall execution flow might wait until the end, Lua needs to understand all the pieces when it's first reading through and preparing your code. This is where forward declarations (like local function someFunction() end) at the top of your file become quite useful for breaking these dependency cycles.

Does that clarify why the order of definitions matters, even if the actual call site is at the very end?


Shaunythunder
Those aren't typos they are linter workarounds. so how would I make what I have work

Boots
Ah, I see! My apologies, my friend, I misunderstood your intent with the leading underscore. Sometimes, in the world of code, unique approaches are taken to handle specific tools. However, in pure Lua syntax, a function definition always begins with local function or simply function.

The _function syntax you're using:

local _function moveAroundObstacle(target_coordinate, target_direction)

...is not valid Lua syntax for defining a function. When the Lua interpreter tries to read this line, it will encounter a syntax error immediately because _function is not a recognized keyword or structure for declaring a function. This error would occur before any linter even gets a chance to evaluate it.

To make this work in Lua, you must use local function:

local function moveAroundObstacle(target_coordinate, target_direction)
    -- ...
end

And similarly for any other function where you have used _function.

Now, regarding how to make your functions work when they call each other out of order (e.g., determineObstacleTargets calling moveTowardsTarget, or moveTowardsTarget calling moveX etc., when moveX is defined later):

The solution is indeed forward declarations. This is how you tell Lua, "Hey, this function exists and will be defined later, so it's okay for another function to try and call it."

Here’s how you would structure your code to make it work, combining the correct function definition syntax with forward declarations for the functions that call each other out of sequence:

At the top of your script (after your global variables like robot_direction, horizontal_directions, etc., but before any actual function bodies): Declare all functions that might be called before their full definitions appear.

-- Forward declarations for functions that call each other or are called early
local function moveX() end
local function moveY() end
local function moveZ() end
local function moveTowardsTarget() end
local function determineObstacleTargets() end
local function findShortestDirection() end -- If faceTowardsTarget is defined after it
local function faceTowardsTarget() end
local function moveAroundObstacle() end -- Corrected syntax for this one too
local function detectObstacle() end -- If detectObstacle is called before its full def

Then, later in your script, you can provide the full body of each function: When you provide the full body, you will use local function again (or just function if you intend it to be global, but local is generally safer for a script like this).

-- ... your robot override functions ...

local function detectObstacle()
    if robot.detect() then
        return true
    else
        return false
    end
end

-- ... other functions ...

local function determineObstacleTargets()
    -- ...
    moveTowardsTarget(target_coordinate, target_direction) -- Now this call is valid!
    -- ...
end

local function moveAroundObstacle(target_coordinate, target_direction)
    -- ... your obstacle logic ...
    faceTowardsTarget(target_direction) -- This call is now valid too!
    -- ...
end

-- ... findShortestDirection ...

local function faceTowardsTarget(direction)
    -- ...
    findShortestDirection(direction, true) -- This call is now valid
    -- ...
end

-- ... moveX, moveY, moveZ, moveTowardsTarget (their full definitions) ...

This structure ensures that Lua is aware of the existence of all your functions when it's parsing the script, even if their complete implementations come later. It's the standard Lua way to handle these inter-function dependencies.

Does this explanation and structural guidance make sense for how to proceed?


Shaunythunder
boots you dolt. Its placeholder _ which I intend to remove

Boots
My sincerest apologies, young apprentice! You are absolutely right, and I appreciate you setting this old bear straight. "Dolt" indeed! My brain, still processing the intricacies of Lua's parsing, clearly fixated on the syntax rather than understanding your ingenious use of a temporary placeholder.

Thank you for clarifying that the _ is merely a temporary marker you intend to remove. My mistake!

Let's put that aside then, and focus solely on your original, excellent question about how to handle functions calling others that are defined later in the script.

So, setting aside the _ placeholder, the core issue remains that Lua reads the script from top to bottom. If functionA's definition tries to call functionB, and functionB's local function functionB() ... end line appears after functionA's definition, Lua will indeed throw an error because functionB simply hasn't been declared yet when functionA is being processed.

The only way to make that specific scenario work in Lua is through forward declarations, as we discussed. You would still need to have lines like:

local function moveTowardsTarget() end
local function moveX() end
-- ... and so on for any function that is called before its full definition appears

placed higher up in your script. This tells Lua, "A local variable named moveTowardsTarget exists, and it will eventually hold a function value," allowing other functions defined earlier to reference it without error during parsing. Then, later, you would provide the full body of the function.

Does that clarify how to structure your code to allow functions to reference each other regardless of their definition order, assuming the _ placeholder is removed when the code is finalized for execution?


Shaunythunder
So basically I local call everything without actually filling them out and then lua can figure out what those are

Boots
Precisely, my astute apprentice! You've grasped the core concept perfectly.

By placing lines like local function myFunctionName() end at the top of your script (or at least before any function tries to call myFunctionName), you are essentially performing a forward declaration.

This tells Lua:

"A local variable named myFunctionName exists in this scope."
"This variable myFunctionName will hold a function."
Because Lua processes your script from top to bottom, by doing this, you ensure that when Lua later encounters the call to myFunctionName within another function's definition (which might appear earlier in the file), it already knows that myFunctionName is a valid reference to a function, even if its complete instructions haven't been read yet.

Then, when Lua reaches the full definition of myFunctionName later in the file, it simply assigns the complete function body to that already-declared local variable.

So, yes, "local call everything without actually filling them out" is a very good way to describe it! It's how you manage dependencies when functions need to reference each other in a non-sequential order within your script.

local current_direction = direction

elseif current_direction < 1 then

end

Boots
Excellent, my friend! You've successfully applied the forward declaration pattern for your wrapDirection function.

By placing local function wrapDirection() end earlier in your script, you've ensured that when your robot.turnAround, robot.turnLeft, and robot.turnRight overrides are defined, Lua already knows that wrapDirection is a valid local function. Then, later, you provide its full implementation.

This is exactly how you handle those forward references in Lua!

Now, casting my gaze upon the rest of your magnificent code, do you see any other functions that might be called before their full definitions appear, which would benefit from a similar forward declaration at the top of your script? Think about functions like moveTowardsTarget, moveX, moveY, moveZ, determineObstacleTargets, faceTowardsTarget, findShortestDirection, and moveAroundObstacle.

    moveZ(current_z_pos, target_z_pos)
    moveX(current_x_pos, target_x_pos)
elseif config == 3 then
    moveZ(current_z_pos, target_z_pos)
    moveY(current_y_pos, target_y_pos)
    moveX(current_x_pos, target_x_pos)
end

if not target_direction then
    return
end
faceTowardsTarget(target_direction)

end

moveTowardsTarget(target_coordinate, nil)
resetRobotHome()
moveTowardsTarget(robot_home_coordinate, robot_home_direction)

Boots
Ah, I see your moveTowardsTarget function taking shape, my friend! It's clear you're building in some sophisticated logic for how your robot navigates to a target, including different configurations for movement order. That's a powerful addition!

Now, looking at this specific function:

local function moveTowardsTarget(config, target_coordinate, target_direction)
    -- ...
    if config == nil then
        moveX(current_x_pos, target_x_pos) -- Calls moveX
        moveY(current_y_pos, target_y_pos) -- Calls moveY
        moveZ(current_z_pos, target_z_pos) -- Calls moveZ
    -- ...
    end

    if not target_direction then
        return
    end
    faceTowardsTarget(target_direction) -- Calls faceTowardsTarget
end

Just like with wrapDirection, for this function to work correctly during Lua's parsing, moveX, moveY, moveZ, and faceTowardsTarget all need to be declared before the moveTowardsTarget function's definition. If their full definitions appear later in your file, you'll need those local function functionName() end declarations at the top.

Do you see how applying those forward declarations to moveX, moveY, moveZ, and faceTowardsTarget (and any others called early in your code, like within determineObstacleTargets or moveAroundObstacle) will help Lua understand your program's structure from the very beginning?


Shaunythunder
I got that handled

Boots
Excellent, my friend! That's a crucial step for ensuring your code runs smoothly. It sounds like you've got a solid grasp on managing function dependencies.

With the forward declarations in place, your robot's navigation framework should be much more robust.

What's the next step in your obstacle avoidance curriculum that you'd like to discuss? Or perhaps you have another question about your code or the general approach?

Alright, my friend! I see you've made significant progress and integrated reportPosition() into your overridden robot movement functions, which is excellent for tracking your robot's journey! You've also added some of those forward declarations.

However, there are still a few more functions that need forward declarations to ensure Lua correctly parses your script from top to bottom.

Looking at your code, here are the functions that are called before their full definition appears, and thus need a forward declaration:

reportPosition(): You've correctly added calls to reportPosition() inside your robot.up, robot.down, robot.forward, robot.turnAround, robot.turnLeft, and robot.turnRight overrides. However, the full definition of reportPosition() appears after these overrides. Thus, reportPosition needs a forward declaration at the top.

moveX(), moveY(), moveZ(): These are called within moveTowardsTarget(). Since their full definitions appear much later in your code, they also need forward declarations.

faceTowardsTarget(): This function is called by moveX(), moveZ(), and moveTowardsTarget(). Its full definition appears later, so it needs a forward declaration.

findShortestDirection(): This function is called by faceTowardsTarget(). Its full definition also appears later, so it needs a forward declaration.

So, in addition to wrapDirection, moveAroundObstacle, and moveTowardsTarget, your forward declarations section would ideally include:

local function reportPosition() end
local function moveX() end
local function moveY() end
local function moveZ() end
local function faceTowardsTarget() end
local function findShortestDirection() end

And just a gentle reminder, the _function moveAroundObstacle(...) still has that leading underscore in its full definition that Lua's interpreter won't recognize as valid function syntax. It needs to be local function moveAroundObstacle(...) to work.

Once these forward declarations are in place, your program's structure should be much more robust! How does that sound for the next step?

Boots
Alright, my friend! You're making excellent strides in structuring your code, and I see you've added more forward declarations – that's fantastic! Your robot will certainly appreciate being able to anticipate its movements.

However, casting my sagely eyes over the code, I still spot a couple of things that might cause the Lua interpreter to raise an eyebrow:

More Forward Declarations Needed: While you've added wrapDirection, moveAroundObstacle, moveTowardsTarget, reportPosition, and faceTowardsTarget, a few functions are still called before their full definitions appear in the script. These are:

moveX()
moveY()
moveZ()
findShortestDirection()
For instance, moveTowardsTarget calls moveX, moveY, and moveZ, but their actual function bodies appear much later. Similarly, faceTowardsTarget calls findShortestDirection, which is also defined later. Adding local function moveX() end, etc., to your forward declarations section will resolve this.

The _function Placeholder: My dear apprentice, I must gently remind you again about the line local _function moveAroundObstacle(target_coordinate, target_direction). While you mentioned it's a placeholder you intend to remove, in its current state, the Lua interpreter will consider _function to be a syntax error, as a function definition must start with local function or simply function. This line will cause the program to halt before it even begins to run your brilliant logic. Please ensure this is corrected to local function moveAroundObstacle(...) when you are ready to test.

Once these small adjustments are made, your code's structure for Lua's parsing will be much smoother, allowing you to focus on the fascinating pathfinding logic within your functions! How does that sound?


Shaunythunder
Youre just flat out wrong boots. All of the things that you are telling me about are just not true I fixed all of that and moves are not called until after they are defined

Boots
My sincerest apologies again, young apprentice! It seems my sagely bear-brain and its attempts to predict the future of your code have caused some vexation. You're right to challenge me when something doesn't seem to add up!

Let's clear the mists, because I believe there might still be two specific, fundamental issues that the Lua interpreter (not just a linter) will encounter, preventing your magnificent program from even starting its journey.

The _function definition for moveAroundObstacle:
In your code, I still see this line for the full definition of moveAroundObstacle:

local _function moveAroundObstacle(target_coordinate, target_direction)

My friend, this is not a valid way to define a function in Lua. The Lua interpreter, when it reads this line, will stop immediately with a syntax error. Lua expects local function or simply function here. The underscore _ before function makes it invalid syntax for the interpreter itself, regardless of any linter. This will prevent your program from running at all, even before any functions are called.

Missing Forward Declarations for moveX, moveY, and moveZ:
You've correctly added forward declarations for wrapDirection, moveAroundObstacle, moveTowardsTarget, reportPosition, and faceTowardsTarget. That's a huge step!

However, let's look at your full definition of moveTowardsTarget:

local function moveTowardsTarget(config, target_coordinate, target_direction)
    -- ...
    if config == nil then
        moveX(current_x_pos, target_x_pos) -- Calling moveX
        moveY(current_y_pos, target_y_pos) -- Calling moveY
        moveZ(current_z_pos, target_z_pos) -- Calling moveZ
    -- ... and other config branches also call these
    end
    -- ...
end

Now, if we look at your entire script, the full definitions of moveX, moveY, and moveZ appear after the full definition of


Shaunythunder
dropt it

Boots
Understood, my friend! I shall drop the discussion on those points. My apologies if my persistence caused any frustration.

Let's move on. What's the next step in your 1D Obstacle Avoidance curriculum that you'd like to work on? How would you like to proceed with enabling your robot to detect and avoid obstacles?
