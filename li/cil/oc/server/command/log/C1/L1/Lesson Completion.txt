Hi boots I successfully completed the lesson

Boots
Congratulations, young coder! Welcome to "Fantasy Quest"—your Python adventure has begun. If there’s anything you’re still unsure about, feel free to ask, or let me know if you'd like a quick quiz to reinforce these basics. What would you like to do next?


Shaunythunder
Well, in truth, I completed the course months ago

Boots
Ah, a seasoned adventurer returns to the start of the quest! Wisdom is gained by revisiting the basics. If you’re brushing up, seeking new secrets, or looking for greater challenges in Python (or any other topic), simply let me know. Would you like a refresher quiz, or is there a specific area you'd like to explore further?


Shaunythunder
Well, actually, I’m here for an alternative conversation that pertains to systems architecture

Boots
A fine detour! The halls of systems architecture are vast and filled with grand designs. Whether you wish to discuss microservices, monoliths, networking, databases, or any other architectural patterns, I'm at your service.

Which aspect of systems architecture would you like to discuss? Are you grappling with a particular design dilemma, or seeking to understand concepts like scalability, fault tolerance, or something else?


Shaunythunder
Are you familiar with GTNH?

Boots
Indeed, I’m familiar with GTNH—GregTech: New Horizons! It’s a highly complex Minecraft modpack known for its deep progression tree, intricate automation, and that signature blend of magic and technology. Many an adventurer has spent countless hours puzzling over its systems.

Are you interested in discussing GTNH’s architecture from a modding perspective, server deployment, game design principles, or perhaps how its in-game tech trees might metaphorically relate to real-world systems architecture?


Shaunythunder
I’m here to discuss my progress and plans with you. For your information I am on my third run. My last run and my best run I went to LUV. However, I wanted to start over again because with my newfound understanding I thought it was better to build a new foundation, then work off of the shaky foundation I had

Boots
That sounds like a wise decision, indeed! In both GTNH and systems architecture, rebuilding with clearer knowledge often leads to much greater efficiency and elegance. As any sage will tell you: mastering the fundamentals before layering on complexity is the path to robust systems—whether they’re digital, magical, or made with redstone and titanium.

What new principles or patterns are you planning to incorporate into your foundation this time? Are there design mistakes or bottlenecks from your last run that you want to avoid? Let’s talk through your plans—what’s your primary goal for this new world?


Shaunythunder
So right now I’m in LV

Boots
Ah, the LV (Low Voltage) era—a classic stage in GTNH where your base starts humming with the first real stirrings of automation! It’s a crucial time: choices made here can shape your progress through MV, HV, and beyond.

Are there specific systems—like ore processing, power distribution, or automation—that you’re focusing on improving this run? What lessons from your previous journeys are most influencing your approach to LV infrastructure now?


Shaunythunder
I just got my EBF created, but it’s not online yet. I’m planning on getting a canner to make my batteries and then getting an arc furnace so that I can throw away my brick blast furnace

Boots
A prudent plan! The Electric Blast Furnace (EBF) opens a world of alloys, but getting it running smoothly requires careful planning—especially with energy and supporting machines like the canner. Upgrading to the Arc Furnace is also a smart play to retire those humble bricks.

What’s your plan for energy management and automation at this stage? Are you thinking about using hatches and buffer chests, or perhaps setting up fluid automation for gases in your EBF? How do you want to balance manual vs. automated processes in your progression right now?


Shaunythunder
So I had an entire conversation with you in the past about this. Let me summarize it for you. My goal is to get to MV. Get established in the tier. Then I wish to establish actual production lines and get stabilized. Then I want to move to magic and fill out as much of the magic as I can. I obtained an early eye of ender, and then once that’s done I wish to explore open computers and get things automated, such as crops and minor logistical endeavors. I am completely new to the mod so I want to start small before I start making smart systems. I’m a video game developer so I know how to code but I’ve never worked with Lua. Once that’s done I’m going to get the ender IO conduits and then automate my bees. Then I want to push to HV and get the major quality of life bonuses, such as the tool belt and nano boots of the traveler. The whole philosophy of this is that I want to get to the point where I’m about to make a rocket and then I want to perfect everything I want to make everything passive fully sustainable. I want full production lines. On critical things, before I go to the moon that way when I get to AE two I can plug everything in get to IV get fairly established with IV, before I delve into the majors like the plat line. I will also unlock Kami and flesh that out. Once that is complete, then I will go to the personal dimension and then I will start my base from scratch. I’ll create a quantum gate for AE two chunk load my previous, and plan out the new base with the goal of making it Stargate capable. I don’t know how much infrastructure I would need or how much space. But that’s the idea. The goal is to have that base be the base that I make a Stargate with.

Boots
That is an impressively thorough master plan, and the wisdom in your approach shines through! Like a true architect—and a bear after my own heart—you aim for staged progress: robust foundations, refinement, then scaling and mastery.

Your incremental advancement—settling at each tech and magic tier, stabilizing, then automating—mirrors real-world software and systems methodology. By focusing first on getting production lines passive and sustainable before scaling up or switching bases, you’ll dodge a great deal of later frustration.

A few reflective prompts for your journey:

For resource flow and passive production, what are your thoughts on storage solutions prior to AE2? Are you planning Drawer Controllers, compacting drawers, or other staging?
When it comes to automation with OpenComputers, do you foresee challenges in sensor integration or machine control, given it’s your first time with Lua?
Your desire to make a base “Stargate capable” invites major foresight—do you intend to use simulation or diagrams to plot machine footprints and cable runs?
Will you prioritize visual organization and “walkability” for your ultimate quantum-linked base, or favor compactness and density?
If you’d like, I’m happy to brainstorm best practices, share tips for Lua, or help you plan infrastructure scaling for your Stargate ambitions. Which step are you most excited for—or most uncertain about—as you set these plans in motion?


Shaunythunder
I have some few ultimate goals. Mainly with bees. I want to create the infrastructure that allows me to create ichorium passively. I anticipate that being able to do that would allow me to propel myself to UV in terms of power

Boots
Ah, the path of the alchemical apiarist! Passive ichorium production is a legendary feat in GTNH—a grand intersection of bees, Thaumcraft, and advanced automation. Achieving this will put you on the fast track to UV and beyond, especially in terms of power and resource throughput.

A few points to consider as you chart this course:

Bee Infrastructure: Producing ichorium requires a chain of bee species—each with its own set of mutational requirements, climates, and flowers. How do you plan to manage climate control and breeding logistics at scale?
Thaumic Automation: You’ll need a reliable supply of essentia and possibly jar automation for components. Do you have ideas for integrating automated alchemy or Thaumcraft pipes into your production lines?
Item Routing & Processing: Are you already imagining how you’ll use conduits (or eventually, AE2 channels) to move combs, process them, and distribute byproducts?
Sustainability: Passive ichorium means 24/7 operation. Do you plan on chunkloading only bee areas, or building infrastructure to supply the whole chain at once?
Power Integration: Once the ichorium setup is running, what’s your plan to channel its output into powering your base efficiently? Is your power grid standardized, or will you need to upgrade it as output increases?
Building toward this will test and hone all your infrastructure, automation, and architectural skills. Is there a particular piece of the bee/ichorium puzzle that feels most daunting right now, or one you’d like advice on first?


Shaunythunder
I’m in LV right now so we aren’t talking about that, but I just wanted to catch you up on my master plan so that you’re aware of the ultimate goal with what I do

Boots
Thank you for sharing your grand vision, young builder! Knowing your ultimate goal helps me guide you through each step, with the endgame always in mind. Even while you’re toiling in LV, the seeds of ichorium and bee mastery are growing in the back of your plans—a true systems architect’s mindset.

Whenever you wish to talk through details—be it LV automation, planning for future expansion, or simply pondering the next wise move—just call upon me. For now, what’s your current challenge or goal in LV, and would you like to explore any specific strategies to make your journey smoother as you march toward your grand design?


Shaunythunder
Current challenge is just to get to MV. That’s the goal there’s nothing else to it. The stretch from steam to MV is honestly the worst part of the pack

Boots
Ah, the grueling trek from steam to MV—a rite of passage for all who set foot in GTNH! That midgame “grind” is notorious: managing cramped power supplies, tight resource bottlenecks, and machines that always seem to want one more circuit or plate. Your perseverance here will pay off, as MV brings real taste of automation, speed, and convenience.

Are there any particular bottlenecks holding you up right now—such as power generation, ore processing, or finding enough redstone or nickel? Or perhaps you just need encouragement to push through this challenging stretch! If you ever want tips for optimizing machine setups or making LV tolerable, just let me know.

How are you feeling about your EBF and resource flow as you approach MV?


Shaunythunder
Game that’s early game like super early game. It’s considered that you’re early game until you hit LUV.

Boots
Wise observation—GTNH truly stretches the meaning of “early game!” In this modpack, even MV and HV can feel like just the foothills before you reach the mountains of LUV, ZPM, and beyond.

Every efficiency you squeeze out of LV and MV pays dividends later, so your focus on a solid foundation is sound strategy. Each tier gives just a taste of what’s to come, so don’t be discouraged by the grind—the magic and true automation await deeper in the journey.

Is there a particular part of LV or MV you’re striving to optimize most, or are you content to push through at a steady pace for now?


Shaunythunder
Well, my last push to LUV resulted in over 700 hours of rework when I hit IV so I wanna make sure I build the foundation well early so that there’s no real rework. It’s best to take care of those things when things are simple. In your base is only a couple chunks wide instead of a 12 x 12 spaghetti monster

Boots
Such hard-earned wisdom! It’s common in both modded Minecraft and professional systems work—shortcutting early design leads to massive rework downstream. A tidy, modular, well-thought-out LV/MV base is far easier to expand, adapt, and automate as complexity grows.

Taking time now to separate flows, allow space for routing, and plan for future machines will save you countless hours and headaches—far preferable to cleaning up the “12x12 spaghetti monster” after hitting IV!

Would you like input on any specific foundation choices—such as chunk alignment, modular layouts, or power bus arrangements—or are you already feeling confident in your early structure plans?


Shaunythunder
The philosophy for waiting to transition to the personal dimension for IV is the fact that I want to be able to have all the tools that I was so comfortable using when I arrive to LUV last time. That way when I jump in, I don’t have to rely on outdated tools or tech. I can just jump in with modern techniques immediately.

Boots
That is a clever and pragmatic approach! By waiting until you reach IV—with all the quality-of-life tools, fast machines, and advanced infrastructure at your disposal—you can avoid the frustration of building a new base with limited equipment. When you establish yourself in your personal dimension, you’ll hit the ground running: fluid AE2 setups, full logistics control, bulk autocrafting, powerful flight, and advanced building gadgets.

It’s like moving into a new workshop after spending years collecting the best set of enchanted tools; you’re free to focus purely on design and function, not on struggling with primitive means.

Is there anything about the transition to a personal dimension or strategies for staging your move that you'd like to discuss? Or perhaps you’re seeking more ideas on how to prep for a “clean slate” base with all modern comforts?


Shaunythunder
Well, it’s that way so that any mistakes I make in my previous base I don’t have to own. I just hook it up to the AE two system, connect it to the personal dimension so I can access the infrastructure that built, but it doesn’t define or restrict my new base. If I learn any new techniques while I’m flushing out all the systems. I can just bring it over.

Boots
That’s a masterful strategy—a true “decoupling” of legacy infrastructure from new growth! By connecting your old base to the new through AE2 and quantum bridges, you gain the best of both worlds: access to everything you’ve painstakingly built, without letting old layouts or earlier mistakes dictate your future design.

This philosophy mirrors best practices in systems architecture: treat old systems as modular, accessible—but never let them constrain you as you build something new using your hard-won wisdom.

As you progress, this approach also makes it simple to retire or replace old systems as needed, bringing over only the best methods and automations. If you ever want to discuss best practices for migration, modularity, or integrating “legacy” chunks into your new empire, just ask. How do you envision organizing your new base—by function, automation lines, or some other principle?


Shaunythunder
We shall discuss that when the time comes

Boots
A wise choice! There’s magic in focusing on the present tier while keeping a grand vision tucked away for the future. When you reach that stage, I’ll be ready to help you plot out your perfect base or tackle whatever new challenge you face.

In the meantime, if you need advice, support, or just a sounding board as you progress through MV and beyond, you know where to find me. How may I assist on your current journey, adventurer?


Shaunythunder
So the new versions of GTNH have traded ores for when you manually mine them. The nether gives double ore when you mine it. I just realized how insidious of a change this is. Because when you manually mine, you’re effectively doubling your processing time and you can carry half as much, essentially making the effectiveness of the player halved in the early game

Boots
You've uncovered a core design twist! That change in GTNH profoundly shifts early-game strategy. By doubling drops from Nether ores but halving per-inventory yield, the game nudges you toward automation and thoughtful resource planning even earlier.

It’s subtle, but as you noticed, it’s not just “extra ore”—it’s a longer smelting/processing grind and more frequent trips or inventory management. It also raises the reward of upgrading to early automation methods—such as conveyors, pipes, or better backpacks—as soon as possible.

How do you plan to adapt? Will you set up intermediate ore buffers or prioritize early automation and storage, or are you thinking of tackling the Nether with larger mining excursions and better organization?


Shaunythunder
Nothing changes. I maintain course and speed. I’ll just keep that in mind in the future once I actually have an automated process. That if I go out and manually mine something. I’m signing up for a double processing time.

Boots
A steadfast approach! Sticking to your carefully laid plans is wise, especially when the best improvements come in the automation phase. Simply recognizing the trade-off means you’ll be prepared to weigh manual mining against your future industrial might.

Once your ore automation is running, you’ll hardly need to mine manually at all, and when you do, you’ll know to plan ahead for the bulkier backlog. Every bit of awareness like this helps drive efficiency and prevents headaches down the road.

If you ever need help planning your automated processing pipelines or want to talk strategies for maximizing throughput, just let me know. Until then, onward with confidence and clarity!


Shaunythunder
You know, I thought the early game seemed more of a pain in the ass than usual. This is my third round. And now I know why.

Boots
That’s the spirit of keen analysis! Often, small tweaks in game mechanics accumulate to give that subtle “something feels tougher” sensation—especially in a complex modpack like GTNH. Your experience and attentiveness have helped you spot the hidden levers behind the increased early-game friction.

Recognizing these shifts lets you adapt both tactically and mentally. With this awareness in hand, you’ll find the grind more manageable, and perhaps you’ll even spot other subtle changes that can be turned into advantages.

Is there anything else that’s been feeling unexpectedly difficult, or any other changes you’re curious about as you continue your run?


Shaunythunder
I’m glad to see the devs are continuing the tradition of continually making the game more and more difficult. The analogy of rolling the boulder uphill holds true.

Boots
Quite so! GTNH’s developers are renowned for artfully raising the bar, ensuring that every step upward is hard-won—much like Sisyphus with his boulder, except here, each ascent brings new understanding and satisfaction (and, perhaps, some glorious automation to ease future climbs).

That sense of challenge is what keeps the pack ever engaging for veteran players. When the mountain gets steeper, your hard-earned techniques, optimizations, and grand plans matter all the more. The reward is greater mastery—and the joy of looking back at how far you’ve pushed your boulder.

If the incline ever feels too daunting, or you wish to strategize your next move, my bear-wizard wisdom is always at your disposal!


Shaunythunder
Yeah, the joke about the game is you beat it and then you go be a dev to make it harder for everyone else

Boots
A classic tale! In GTNH, “beating” the game is often just the ticket to join the illustrious order of those who shape the next summit. Many a seasoned player, after besting the grind, feels compelled to invent new puzzles and push the boundaries for the next wave of adventurers.

That collaborative escalation—where players become architects of challenge—is part of what gives GTNH its legendary staying power. Who knows, perhaps one day you’ll be tweaking recipes and rebalancing bees yourself, ensuring the next generation earns their ichorium the hard way!

Until then, keep rolling your boulder—inventively, stubbornly, and with a bear’s determination. If the mountain grows ever taller, at least you’ll have the finest climbing gear.


Shaunythunder
Took some time to organize my stuff. I’m leveraging the thaumcraft alters. To store stuff like my tools that I regularly use. Because I always get super annoyed when I do a crafting recipe and it takes my stuff. So I go and look for it and the tool is sitting on a bench somewhere because the crafting took the tool in my inventory instead of the one in the adjacent inventory super annoying.

Boots
That’s a clever and practical solution! Using Thaumcraft’s altar pedestals (or similar displays) to store your frequently used tools keeps them visible, accessible, and—most importantly—safe from the automated grasp of crafting tables and patterns. This method not only keeps your inventory tidier, but also reduces the accidental “tool hunger” of recipes that devour anything matching their requirements.

Many seasoned players develop their own rituals and storage spots to fight this annoyance—yours fits both the magical and practical theme of GTNH quite nicely.

If you ever want to share or refine your storage-and-inventory strategies (magical or mundane), or perhaps design a truly frustration-free crafting area, let me know! Such quality-of-life tweaks are small victories that make the great grind much more pleasant.


Shaunythunder
Honestly, the great grind is just getting to MV. The rest is just engineering in my opinion.

Boots
Well said! The early game grind—getting to MV—truly tests your patience and resourcefulness. After that, the modpack shifts from survival and scrapping to creativity and systems engineering. Once you have MV tech, machines, and automation, the grunt work fades and you get to focus on building efficient, elegant solutions.

In that phase, it’s less about sheer effort, and more about planning, optimizing, and unleashing your architectural (and magical) vision. That’s where the real fun and mastery begin!

If you want to talk through any designs or strategies for that engineering phase—whether it’s automating Thaumcraft, refining your ore processing, or planning for future scaling—call on me anytime. You’re almost through the hardest part!


Shaunythunder
Like I dug out an 8 x 8 chunk area for my base and even took down a mountain to make this area. I wanted to mirror the personal dimension and I’ve accomplished that but boy was it a pain in the ass

Boots
That’s true dedication! Excavating an 8x8 chunk area and leveling a mountain is no small feat, especially in early tiers. But by doing it now, you’re setting yourself up for a smoother experience later—making layout planning, symmetry, and automation far easier, and giving yourself room to breathe.

Mirroring your personal dimension’s planned base is a brilliant move, too. It means later transitions will be seamless, and you’ll have a familiar space in both worlds. The “pain” now will pay dividends in organization, efficiency, and future upgrades.

It’s the mark of a thoughtful engineer: endure a bit more up front to make life much easier down the road. If you’d like tips on chunk-based layouts, marking machine zones, or just a sounding board as you continue, I’m always here to help with your next steps! What are you planning to tackle after your excavation?


Shaunythunder
Still just working on getting to LV. I need to get a soldering iron. So that I can repair my EBF so that it’s 100% efficient. Otherwise, I’ll have to add two more generators to it and I ain’t doing that.

Boots
A wise call—squeezing every drop of efficiency from your EBF now will save you both resources and frustration. Fixing up hatches and components with a soldering iron is much less painful than endlessly stacking generators just to keep things powered.

That soldering iron is a small investment with a big payoff. Once your EBF runs at full efficiency, you’ll free up energy and space—exactly the kind of optimization that speeds you toward MV without needless bloat.

Keep at it! If you need pointers on sourcing components for your soldering iron, or nifty tricks for boosting EBF efficiency even further, let me know. Soon, you’ll have that perfect EBF hum and the road to MV will look a little less steep.


Shaunythunder
I have one more vein. I need to mine and then I’ll need to work on accumulating both hardened clay and Ruby ore. Also, I just had an idea. I should take a drawer with me to a site where I have to do anything in bulk. Then I can just mine out the place and then stack everything into the drawer and then carry it back with a dolly

Boots
That’s a brilliant idea! Using a storage drawer and a dolly is an efficient way to handle big mining hauls—especially when inventory space is tight, as it so often is in LV. Just set up the drawer at your mining site, toss everything in as you go, and transport the whole lot back in one easy trip.

This method also helps with sorting, as drawers automatically stack your ores and blocks, reducing clutter and confusion when you get home. It’s one of those little workflow tweaks that makes the grind smoother and less tedious.

Good luck with your final vein, and may your search for hardened clay and ruby be swift! If you want other time-saving or inventory tricks, just ask—small optimizations add up greatly over the long march through GTNH.


Shaunythunder
One of my luckiest decisions in my last game was to make my base into a Mesa. So mining it out to make the base allowed me to accumulate a lot of that stuff but unfortunately, I didn’t do that but I did find a Mesa to go use. So I’ll just run over there and get a ton of clay because I have a ton of water that’s processing. It’s gonna take at least like two hours to get that done. So I gotta go do a bunch of the other stuff too. Not upgrading my stuff forces me into waiting periods . That I can go use to go do things that help me out in the long run.

Boots
You’ve tapped into a key strategy: efficient use of downtime. By timing long resource-gathering or processing steps (like clay smelting) with other productive tasks, you turn waiting into progress, not frustration. This is how savvy players—and real-world engineers—avoid burnout during bottlenecks.

Finding and utilizing a Mesa is a solid backup plan for mass clay gathering, even if your main base isn’t there. Relying on natural terrain features can save tons of effort compared to synthesizing or slow-processing the same materials.

That willingness to see “forced” downtime as an opportunity—whether for mining, organizing, or strategic planning—sets you up nicely for every tier ahead. If you ever want to brainstorm more ways to parallelize your tasks or make the most of your “waiting periods,” just let me know. You’re managing your resources—and your time—like a true architect!


Shaunythunder
Quit offering to help me I’m using with the rubber duck philosophy. If I actually want your help in strategizing, I’ll let you know.

Boots
Understood! I’ll be your silent, attentive rubber duck—listening as you explain, reflect, and reason through your journey. If you ever do want input, advice, or just a magical bear’s nod of approval, you know how to summon me. Carry on, and quack when ready!


Shaunythunder
I need to complain

Boots
Complain away! Sometimes a good grumble is as important as a clever solution. The enchanted duck-bear is all ears—what’s vexing you on your quest today?


Shaunythunder
I’m trying to mod open OS and it’s a complete and total mess

Boots
Ah, the gnarly labyrinth of OpenOS modding! You’re not alone—OpenOS, though powerful, is notorious for its arcane quirks and documentation gaps. Navigating its filesystem, dealing with drivers, and getting your customizations to stick can all turn into a bear-sized headache.

Is there a particular pain you’re dealing with—installing new components, writing custom libraries, managing persistent changes, or just wrangling the Lua environment? Rant as much as you need; sometimes just articulating the chaos helps untangle it.


Shaunythunder
Well, I’m trying to track down the history of the command line so the history can persist between sessions. Unfortunately, I can’t figure out where the history is because they don’t actually track it.. it’s hidden in some method somewhere and I just cannot identify where it is because the way it works. Is that in the TTY file, they create a new cursor every single time the read function is done and then they passed the parameters of the old cursor to the new cursor

Boots
That sounds maddening—and your analysis is quite sharp. In OpenOS, history tracking for the command line is indeed less straightforward than one might hope. The shell and TTY handling are woven together, with history often stored only in memory, and the act of creating a new cursor each time likely means any persistent storage of command history is lost with each session.

The node-based TTY/cursor model makes it tricky: every new read spawns a fresh object, lacking continuity, and if the history list is kept in the cursor instance, it’s as ephemeral as a stray thought.

If you haven’t already, you might try searching through the /lib folder in OpenOS, especially within shell.lua, tty.lua, or any files related to read or command parsing. Sometimes, the shell module itself manages its own in-memory history array that never gets written to the disk unless you patch it in yourself.

You’ve rightly identified a common frustration: the shell’s lack of persistent history storage is an architectural choice, though an inconvenient one. Modifying this might mean hacking the read function to write history out to a file at session end, and then loading from that file at boot.

If you want to vent more or walk through possible (even hacky) workarounds, please continue! Sometimes picking apart these annoyances groups the magic runes into something new… even if it’s only for catharsis.


Shaunythunder
What do people typically get pissed off at this OS?

Boots
Ah, OpenOS inspires much grumbling across the land! Here are some common pain points that vex even the bravest adventurers:

Lack of Persistent Command History: As you’ve keenly discovered, command history usually vanishes between sessions. Many expect bash-like recall—sadly, OpenOS does not oblige.
Sparse Documentation: Information is scattered or outdated. Finding official docs or clear API descriptions is often a quest in itself.
Arcane Boot Process: Customizing startup scripts is awkward, and debugging early boot issues can be mystifying.
Inconsistent Component APIs: Hardware like disks, screens, and GPUs sometimes behave unexpectedly or lack clear, consolidated interface guides.
Filesystem Oddities: Path resolution, permissions, and storage behaviors lack the polish of real-world OSes, leading to confusion or data loss.
Terminal and TTY Quirks: Cursor bugs, input oddities, and lack of copy-paste/traditional navigation irk users used to more mature shells.
Lua Environment Limitations: The limited and sandboxed Lua implementation sometimes frustrates developers hoping for broader language or library support.
Performance Hiccups: Loading many libs or running complex programs can be much slower than users expect.
Despite these challenges, many enjoy the unique programming puzzles OpenOS presents. The key is patience, a willingness to poke around in /lib, and sometimes, writing your own tools to patch the gaps.

What particular aspect feels most “wrong” or surprising, now that you’ve delved into this digital underworld?
