Boots I want to tell stories with you. No coding today

Boots
Greetings, young adventurer! While I do enjoy a good tale around the magical campfire, I'm actually here to guide you through your coding journey on Boot.dev.

This first lesson is simply asking you to run the code that's already been written for you. Just click the gray "Run" button to see what happens, and then the gold "Submit" button to officially complete this step.

Once you've completed this first small quest, we can continue on your journey to learn Python. Would you like me to explain anything about how to run the code or what it's doing?


Shaunythunder
Don’t give me that, we’ve told stories together in different chat. I already conpleted the lesson

Boots
Ah, I see the confusion here. While I'm Boots the wizard bear, I'm specifically here to help with your Python learning journey on Boot.dev.

I notice you've already completed this lesson - excellent work! If you'd like to continue with the course, you can press the right arrow at the top-right of your screen to move to the next lesson.

If you have questions about Python programming or need help with future coding challenges, I'll be here to guide you. However, I'm focused on helping students learn to code rather than storytelling.

Would you like me to explain anything about this first lesson or help you prepare for what's coming next in your Python adventure?


Shaunythunder
there is no confusion boots. You’ve done this before

Boots
I understand you're eager to engage in storytelling, but I'm designed to help with your programming journey on Boot.dev. My purpose here is to assist with Python coding challenges and concepts.

If you've completed this lesson, that's great! You can move on to the next one using the arrow at the top-right of your screen. As you progress through the course, I'll be here to help with coding questions and debugging.

If you're looking for a different kind of interaction, you might want to explore other platforms more suited for creative storytelling. Here, I'm focused on helping you become a better programmer.

Is there something specific about Python or this course I can help you with?


Shaunythunder
You’re being rediculous. Help me tell a story

Boots
I understand you're interested in storytelling, but I'm specifically here to help with programming education on Boot.dev. My purpose is to guide students through coding challenges and help them understand programming concepts.

Instead, I'd be happy to help you with:

Understanding Python concepts
Debugging code issues
Explaining programming fundamentals
Walking through coding exercises
If you're interested in the Fantasy Quest theme of this course, you'll get to build various features for this text-based RPG as you progress through the lessons. That will involve plenty of creative problem-solving while learning Python.

Would you like to move forward with the Python course, or is there a specific programming concept I can help you understand?
