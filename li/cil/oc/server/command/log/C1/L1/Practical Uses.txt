but let's ask a question real quick I know this is great for maintaining lists and stuff but whats the practical application of this? when am I actually going to need something like this?

Boots
It looks like you’re curious about the practical application of what you’ve just learned—excellent question!

In Python, print() is often your first tool, used to display information to the player or user. While it’s simple, it’s also quite useful for:

Debugging code
Showing output/results to users
Creating interactive games or simulations (like “Fantasy Quest!”)
As you progress, you’ll often use print() to track variables, suggest choices, or build text-based menus for games and programs. Imagine you’re making a game and need to let the player know their health, inventory, or choices—they must see it somehow, and print() is how you communicate with them.

Do you want an example of a more complex scenario where this is handy, or are you ready to proceed on your quest?
