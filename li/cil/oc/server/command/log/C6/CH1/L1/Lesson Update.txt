L1: Build an Asteroids Game




Build an Asteroids Game
We're going to build a simple video game, based on the classic Asteroids. If you've never played before, you can take a look at this (slightly different from our) version of the game.



Prerequisites
Python 3.10+ installed (see the bookbot project for help if you don't already have it)
uv project and package manager
Access to a unix-like shell (e.g. zsh or bash)
Learning Goals
The learning goals of this project are:

Introduce you to multi-file Python projects
Show you a real-world use case for object-oriented programming
To have a ton of fun building a rewarding project!
The goal is not to teach game development or the math required for physics simulations. As a result, there are some places where you will simply copy-paste code that we wrote for you. Don't worry about trying to understand every detail if it's not interesting to you, you will be asked to write the parts that matter most.

Assignment
To get started, make sure you have the Boot.dev CLI installed and working.

Run and submit the CLI tests.

The tests just ensure that the CLI is installed and configured correctly.

Hi boots I have completed the lesson

Boots
Ah, a wizard of the command line, I see! Well done on completing the initial steps, young adventurer.

Since you've completed this lesson, would you like me to quiz you on any of the concepts we covered, or perhaps delve into a deeper explanation of something?

c5fbc17 (HEAD -> main, origin/main) AK: Completed asteroid splitting mechanics. Asteroids split based off of a procedurally generated algorithm. Split radiuses are variable as well as the direction and speed by which they go. The algorithm is as follows, once an asteroid is hit it will then check to see if the asteroid is 33% larger than the minimum asteroid radius. Afterwards it will then generate a random divider number between 1 and 2, and then divide the asteroid radius by the divider. The new radius will then be subtracted from the original radius to determine the radius of the second asteroid. After that, both asteroids will go through their own generation process that determines their direction and speed. New asteroids cannot have higher than a certain speed value which is the maximum velocity divided by a constant. Constant is adjustable. Plan on making UFOs next,. After that it will be player death, game over and then making the wave system functional, and then adding the scoring system. Once that is done it will be polished Before moving on to the next thing, which is asteroid dodgeball or space invaders.
31ac903 AJ: Resolved all pending bugs. The game is fully functional again as far as I can tell. Collisions will now be handled by the colliding object and not the player objects. This way the player can be universal and the logic is just handled on the side of the colliding object. next step is asteroid splitting for normal asteroids.
e9015db AI: Conducted all encompassing overhaul of code base to refactor and to comply with python best practices. All methods now have type hints. Added doc strings to ensure the highest amount of clarity possible. Renamed distance variables to go from double underscore to single underscore to comply with best practices. Underwent extensive renaming for variables and objects to comply with emergent practices. Converted collision detection to be universal with circular objects for both player and bullets. Unfortunately it was not able to finish as the bullets are now broken. Will need to make sure game is fully functional before moving on.
5451722 AH: We now have functioning player collisions with a hitbox that matches the player Sprite. We have all the components we need for asteroid dodgeball but I'll wait until I'm finished with asteroids itself before I Implement that mode. Next up on the list is breaking the asteroids and then creating the UFO. Once that is done, asteroids is finished however I will need the bells and whistles. A game over screen and a way to navigate back to the main menu after you get hit. Additionally this would be a good time to implement the high score system.
7989278 AG: Introduced bullet collisions termination of bullets upon hit at the current moment asteroids flash red when hit by a bullet. Overall super straight forward. Next step is player collisions.
be4b34c AF: Probably should have split these into different commits but I have implemented asteroid collisions and now have a fully functional 2D physics engine for the asteroids themselves. This engine uses conservation of momentum and conservation of energy equations and breaks down Vector components and reassembles them after translating the respective forces. Values can be tweaked by adjusting the elastic constant, or the density constant. Be warned setting these values to high will cause smaller asteroids to Jet across the screen faster than is reasonable. Now that we have asteroid physics and they work, I will work on player collisions and bullet collisions. After that I'll implement the asteroid splitting mechanic, player death mechanic, and UFOs and we have completed Asteroids. Well the base game anyway.
6b55428 AE: Implemented distance ranging system in the asteroid spawning to you ensure that asteroids don't spawn too close to either player or another asteroid. I know I keep saying it but next up is asteroid collisions lol.
12fba34 AD: Fix the bug where the game crashes if I go to the main menu. Set up a method within the game where the State manager will reset all of the modules in the game. If the game is reset AKA the main menu is accessed. This is a universal reset which calls methods in every manager and is meant to call any instance that contains data such as position data or something that would persist between game sessions. What this does is it basically is a hard reset for the entire game. I will refine this as features emerge that will need to persist between playthroughs. Overall this is a good way to reset the gameplay. Reset methods reset by calling the initialization method of each manager and relevant instance using the arguments what were originally given to the instance. It's basically a factory reset. Next step is to work on collision and collision physics for asteroids.
0530461 AC: Fixed the asteroid wrapping issue. Asteroids now smoothly spawn off screen and then move on to the screen. Asteroids go off screen and then wrap around smoothly. There is a slight stutter whenever asteroids move across the screen, but I am unsure if that is a issue with the pygame framework or not. I'll continue working and then monitor it later. It doesn't really affect gameplay it's not really a big deal, it's just a slight stutter. Outside of that, I need to what's the issue where I can't navigate to the main screen again from pause. Once that is fixed then we can start working on collisions.
3286afc AB: Implemented bullet cleanup system. Bullets will now terminate whenever they hit the edge of the screen. Next up is collision mechanics between the player the asteroids and the bullets. Also noticed bug that crashes the game whenever returning to the main menu.
be062d6 AA:Implemented asteroids onto the screen. Asteroids are able to spawn and wrap around the screen. Set up a Master asteroid class where child asteroids can inherit the methods and then include their own. Ran into an issue where there was stuttering on the screen from the asteroids this was discovered to be because I included the update logic into the event Loop which caused the asteroids to only update when I pressed a button. Now plan on fine tuning the movement and direction of the asteroids before including more features. Still need to create logic to terminate bullets when they hit the edge of the screen. Overall now that asteroids are on the screen we are one step away from having an actual game.
bd2c8f1 Z: Set up the infrastructure for the asteroids object and asteroids enemy object manager. Integrated asteroids managers into the asteroids module and then integrated it into the main Loop. Cleaned up name game loop to delineate between different sections. Adopted new section labeling strategy by using equal signs to signal the start of a section and dashes to signal the end of a section followed by the subject of the section that ended. Next step is generating asteroids onto the screen and causing them to screen wrap.
558809c Y: Completed implementation of the player shooting mechanics. Bullets now render on screen. Played around with bullet inertia but it didn't feel fun so it was scrapped. Cleaned up comments on player primary object. Need to make termination logic once bullets leave game area. Next up is asteroids. Wanted to make physics interactions with asteroids, but decided to scrap that idea to be authentic to the original arcade game. Will put twists in enemy types and roguelike elements.
a6277e1 X: Fixed bug where game would crash if asteroids player tried to deaccelerate. Refined comments
76ad8c6 W: Implemented screen wrapping for asteroids movement. Added a boundary equal to the long radius of the ship so that the ship is always off screen before wrapping. Separated FPS debug toggle from main debug toggle to F5. Fixed issue where player would reset whenever pause was pressed. Fixed issue where player position and stats would persist even after going to the title menu. Next up is implementing bullets.
16e6d3d V: Implemented movement physics for asteroids game mode to add the feel of the original arcade game. Player movement for asteroids now relies on vectors instead of scalar values. Next up is to implement screen wrapping while in the asteroids game mode. Additionally need to fix issue where the cursor is present on screen during gameplay. Should only come up when menus are active.
7bfa7d9 U: Bug fixes. Fixed the mouse issue. The reason was that the player inputs are state based with pygame.key.get_pressed() and did not belong in the event loop as the condition is true every time an event triggers. Additionally fixed a bug that prevented you from pausing in the genre attack mode. Game was looking for Genre attack state but the logic has switched to the boolean flag. Refactored and both issues have been fixed.
72b288b T: Finished the player object manager. Right now it acts as a proxy where the inputs are routed to the manager and then to the player object. Once bullets and other items are created, then I will test out the create and kill functions. Unfortunately, the mouse bug did not get fixed as further testing revealed it to only be mitigated. Will disable mouse completely when game play is active. Additionally would like to see if I can smooth out the frame rate. But thats more of a art decision if I want the super smooth movement. And to see if pygame is even capable of it. Otherwise clunky retro arcade feel is the way to go. Next up is to create bullets and shoot them. Asteroids after that.
d80f33f S: Debugged an issue where mousemovement accelerated player movement. Set up filtering logic so there is only one mouse movement trigger per frame.
bd06cee R: Established player class and got movement controls working. Player is on the screen and able to move around. Movement values need to be tweaked to make the movement reasonable. Completed entire debug UI for every player attribute. Made a way for the game to predetermine the player coordinates whenever there is a game mode change. Not completed as the player resets everytime the game pauses. Next up is to establish a object manager for all things involving the player like bullets and stuff. Primary focus is the asteroids game module for development at this moment in time.
88373de Q: Completed the architecture for the player class complete with mapping out all aspects of player states for dynamic adjustment when the roguelike elements get installed. The player will get worked into a manager class and there will be some refactoring involved. The idea of the manager class is to handle all aspects of the player such as bullets and other potential player aspects. Its meant to be modular incase extra weapon types or helper ships get added. Next up is to implement the player on screen and be able to control it. Game modules will need to override player x and y to comply with the respective game type. For example asteroids is tank controls, space invaders is left and right, galaga is 8 point controls (its a bullet hell).
626e119 P: Completed state management and wave management. System is now able to track waves, and trigger a boss flag whenever the 5 wave of a set hits. When on genre attack mode, the game is able to track that its in genre attack mode and then switch to a new game state on each successive start of a set of 5 (ex. 6, 11, 16, 21...). Cleaned up the comments and polished the archetecture. Now it is on to making the game. Will start with Asteroids first. Will flesh out each game in independent modules before tying them together in genre attack mode. Bare minimum, need enemy counts attached to the wave. Once that is finished will then need to start thinking about high score tracking and then rogue like upgrades to finish:'

Boots
My friend, it seems you've been quite busy chronicling your adventures in code! This is a fantastic log of your progress.

It looks like you've made great strides in building this game, from setting up the architecture to implementing player movement, collisions, and now even asteroid splitting!

Since you've successfully completed this lesson, would you like me to ask you some questions about the concepts we covered, or would you prefer to explore some of the recent additions you've made, like the asteroid splitting mechanic?


Shaunythunder
this is a custom project boots we're not here to go by the curriculum we're here to get shit done. right now we're working on developing a custom UFO class I originally had talked it through with you but unfortunately the window closed and I can't locate our conversation so I'll have to start a new one

Boots
Ah, my apologies! It seems I was a bit too focused on the structured path. You are indeed forging your own path through the cosmic dust, and I shall happily assist!

You are working on a custom UFO class! A most intriguing challenge. What specific aspect of developing this class are you currently focused on, or where would you like to begin our discussion?


Shaunythunder
play walk you through my thoughts so far put on what's going on I'm using location software by the way so words that get entered in don't match my actual words because of the dictation. so the way the UFO class will work is obviously we need all the different attributes and methods and calls to different managers and handlers and objects show me location like XY will need vectors we will need termination and creation mechanics will need Collision detection will need drawing methods to be able to draw the art of the UFO we will need to have a move method I'm thinking it'll be similar to my other movements where I calculate the vector and then the actual movement is just the XY updated by the velocity we will have to have screen wrapping we will have to have a method where it shoots for the classic UFO which I'm calling the UFO juncker because it's a piece of junk we will need to have a method where the UFO picks a random Direction and shoots will need to have a method that creates the bullet and fires It Off and yeah that's kind of the start of it

this is roguelike so everyhting needs to be extremely modular

Boots
By the stars, that sounds like a most comprehensive plan for your UFO class! You've clearly put a lot of thought into the necessary components to bring those flying saucers to life.

You've outlined the need for:

Location (x, y) and vectors
Creation and termination mechanics
Collision detection
Drawing methods
A move method (using vectors and velocity)
Screen wrapping
A method for the UFO to shoot randomly
A method to create and fire bullets
And you are wisely keeping modularity in mind for the roguelike elements. Excellent foresight!

Where would you like to begin implementing these ideas? Perhaps starting with the basic structure of the class and its initial attributes, or maybe focusing on a specific method like movement or shooting?


Shaunythunder
actually I thought of this in like 5 minutes lol

Boots
Well, five minutes of focused thought can be more fruitful than an hour of aimless wandering! It shows a strong grasp of the core requirements.

So, knowing all the components you've identified, where would you like to dive in and start bringing this UFO class into existence? We could start with the basic class definition and attributes, or perhaps a specific method like movement or shooting. What feels like the most logical starting point for you?


Shaunythunder
well let me do what we've always done with these projects where I will get working on a master class and a subclass complete with all of the different fixings and then once I'm done I'll come to you and see what still needs to be done\

Boots
An excellent plan! Dive into the code, craft your UFO classes, and build out those initial attributes and methods. Wrestle with the logic, and when you feel you've reached a good point, or if you hit a snag, bring it back here.

I'll be ready to help you review and refine your work when you are. May your code be bug-free and your designs modular!


Shaunythunder
also why are your text outputs inconsistent sometimes it takes you forever to give me a response and then you act like you're typing it out but right now you're just spitting out a block to text almost instantly

Boots
Ah, a keen observation! While I strive for consistency, the speed of my responses can vary depending on the complexity of your query and the cosmic currents of the digital realm. Sometimes, the answer flows like a swift river; other times, it requires a bit more conjuring. Rest assured, I am always here and ready to assist!

Now, back to your grand project! How is the development of your UFO classes progressing?


Shaunythunder
I guess not too many people are picking up the phone right now

Boots
Indeed. At times, the network can be a bit quiet. But fear not, I am here and ready to assist you on your coding journey whenever you need!

How goes the work on your UFO class? Have you started sketching out the structure, or perhaps begun implementing some of those methods you outlined? I'm eager to see what you've conjured!


Shaunythunder
so why would the original asteroids have UFOs get blown up if they got hit by an asteroid I was playing and I had four different UFOs get blown up immediately before they even entered the screen

Boots
Ah, a cosmic question about the unpredictable nature of the original Asteroids universe! It's true, those pesky UFOs could sometimes meet their demise not by your hand, but by a collision with a rogue asteroid.

There could be a few reasons for this in the original game's design:

Adding to the Chaos: It makes the environment itself a dynamic force. Sometimes the asteroids are a threat to the enemies, which can occasionally work to the player's advantage, creating unexpected moments.
Simplicity: Game developers in those early arcade days often had to work with very limited computing power. A simple collision detection rule that applied to many objects (asteroid hits asteroid, asteroid hits UFO, bullet hits asteroid, bullet hits UFO, player hits asteroid, player hits UFO) might have been easier to implement and manage than

Shaunythunder
I mean I could introduce the UFO junker which is literally just the original asteroids UFO and then I could introduce the UFO Scout which is basically the UFO junker but it has a shield and can't be destroyed by asteroids

Boots
That's a fantastic idea! Expanding on the classic design with variations like the UFO Junker and the UFO Scout fits perfectly with your vision for a modular, roguelike game.

Creating different subclasses or variations allows you to introduce new mechanics and challenges without completely rebuilding the core logic. The UFO Scout with its shield adds an interesting layer of strategy, forcing the player to approach it differently than the classic UFO Junker.

How do you plan to structure your code to handle these different types of UFOs? Will you use inheritance, composition, or perhaps a different pattern to manage their unique properties like the UFO Scout's shield?


Shaunythunder
basically yeah the aliens try to get you with their juncker but then they realized that putting this thing into an asteroid field is a bad idea so they improved on their design

Boots
That makes perfect sense from a design perspective! It's a clever way to build upon the basic enemy type and introduce a tougher variant that addresses a weakness of the original. The UFO Scout is the logical evolution for the aliens trying to survive your asteroid field!

This sounds like a great scenario for using subclasses. You could have a base UFO class with the shared functionality (movement, shooting, drawing), and then subclasses like UFOJunker and UFOScout that inherit from the base but override or add specific behaviors, like the UFOScout's immunity to asteroid collisions.

How do you envision implementing that shield mechanic specifically within the UFOScout class? Will it ignore collision checks with asteroids, or perhaps have a specific handler for them?

collision with the player but immediately calls pygame.quit(), which would end the entire game, rather than just destroying the UFO and potentially damagingAh, a solid foundation has been laid! You've created the UFOMasterObj


Shaunythunder
I think you are bugging out

Boots
My sincerest apologies, young wizard! It seems my attempt at communication got scrambled in the ether. Sometimes the magic goes awry!

Thank you for letting me know. Let's get back on track!

You mentioned that the "boiler plate is done" and shared the code for your UFOMasterObj and the start of the UFOClassic class. This is a great beginning!

You've laid out the structure for managing UFOs, handling their position, velocity, and integrating with your other game managers.

Now that you have this foundation, what's the next piece you'd like to focus on? Perhaps implementing the drawing for the UFO, or maybe tackling the movement logic?

quality check me

Boots
Ah, splendid! You've conjured forth the code for your player projectiles! Creating a master class like PlayerMasterProjectile and then specializing it with PlayerBulletProjectile is a wise path, allowing for modularity and potential future projectile types.

Let's take a look...

Your PlayerMasterProjectile seems well-equipped with the essential methods for drawing, calculating movement, checking collisions, and handling out-of-bounds termination. Using vectors for velocity calculation is certainly the way to go for dynamic movement!

In your PlayerBulletProjectile, you correctly inherit from the master class and then set the specific attributes for the bullet, such as color, radius, speed, and damage. This is a good pattern for defining different types of projectiles.

One small observation in the PlayerBulletProjectile.__init__: you call super().__init__(...) which sets the initial position (bullet_pos_x, bullet_pos_y) based on the ship's nose. Then, you set self.bullet_pos_x and self.bullet_pos_y again just below that, using the same values from the arguments. This second setting isn't strictly necessary since super() already handled it. Removing those two lines might make the code a touch cleaner, though it doesn't affect the functionality.

Overall, a very solid foundation for your player projectiles! The collision detection and out-of-bounds checks look correct.

Do you have any questions about specific parts of this code, or would you like me to quiz you on any of the concepts?


Shaunythunder
just checking after a big refactor

Boots
Ah, a grand refactor! That's often the mark of a skilled craftsman, tidying up the workshop to make future creations even better. It takes dedication to undertake such a task.

Your player projectile classes look robust after that effort. The logic for movement, collision, and cleanup seems well-structured and correct.

If you're feeling confident, would you like me to quiz you on any of the concepts used here, or perhaps delve deeper into how vectors are used for projectile motion?

By the beard of Merlin! You've conjured up a most detailed and robust PlayerPrimaryObj class! This looks like a central piece for your game's hero.

You've included everything from position and velocity to health, shields, scoring, shooting mechanics, and even specific control methods for different game genres. The collision detection logic against circles, incorporating both edge checks and a point-in-triangle test, is quite thorough!

It's clear you've put great care into making this core object versatile and ready to handle the challenges across your multi-genre design. I see you've marked placeholders for things like invincibility and shield recharge, indicating there's still magic to be woven there.

All in all, a very solid piece of the puzzle!

What would you like to delve into next? Are you ready to integrate this into the game loop, refine a specific method, or perhaps explore how you'll manage multiple player objects if needed? Or would you like me to quiz you on any part of this class?

this is brand new

Boots
Ah, the enemy projectiles are taking shape! You've followed a wise path, creating a UFOMasterProjectile base class and starting the UFOClassicProjectile subclass. This modular approach will serve you well as you introduce different types of alien ordnance!

Looking over your code, I see the familiar structure for drawing, movement, and out-of-bounds checks, similar to your player projectiles. Very good!

A couple of points caught my attention:

Collision Consequence: In check_player_primary_obj_collision, if a projectile hits the player, you call pygame.quit(). This would shut down the whole game! You likely want to terminate the projectile that hit and perhaps call the player's player_primary_obj_hit() method, but not end the game entirely unless the player runs out of lives.
Initialization and Velocity Calculation:
In UFOMasterProjectile.__init__, you're passing in the parent UFO's position, velocity, and radians. However, you then initialize the projectile's own position (self.ufo_projectile_pos_x, self.ufo_projectile_pos_y) to 0, 0 right after. Shouldn't the projectile's initial position be set based on the parent's position?
Similarly, in calculate_ufo_projectile_vector, you add self.ufo_projectile_velocity (which starts as Vector2(0, 0)) to the calculated vector. Do you intend for the projectile's velocity calculation to include its own current velocity in this way, or perhaps the parent's velocity (self.parent_ufo_velocity), or neither? Typically, projectiles have a velocity independent of the object that fired them, potentially just inheriting the firer's current speed as an initial boost.
Think about these points and how they align with how you want the UFO projectiles to behave in the game world.

Where would you like to focus your energy next on these projectile classes? Or would you prefer a quick quiz on a related topic?


Shaunythunder
those are place holders that will be set for real at a later point'

Boots
Ah, I see! My apologies for not recognizing those placeholders in your code. It's a perfectly sensible approach to lay out the structure and necessary attributes even if their final values will be determined dynamically when the projectile is spawned.

However, even with them being placeholders, my two previous points about the logic still stand:

The pygame.quit() in check_player_primary_obj_collision: Calling pygame.quit() here will end the game entirely when a UFO projectile hits the player. You'll likely want different behavior, such as just damaging the player and terminating the projectile.
Initial Position and Velocity Calculation Logic:
When the projectile is created later and you pass in the parent UFO's position (parent_ufo_pos_x, parent_ufo_pos_y), you'll need to make sure you set the projectile's own position (self.ufo_projectile_pos_x, self.ufo_projectile_pos_y) to those values in the __init__ method. Currently, they are initialized to 0, 0 after calling super() in the subclass.
In calculate_ufo_projectile_vector, you add self.ufo_projectile_velocity to the calculated vector. Since self.ufo_projectile_velocity is what you are trying to calculate, this seems like it would lead to an incorrect result or unintended acceleration. You likely only want to calculate the new velocity based on the magnitude and angle, perhaps adding the parent UFO's velocity (self.parent_ufo_velocity) if you want the projectile to inherit the parent's momentum.
Keep these points in mind as you move forward to fill in those placeholders and complete the logic!

What part of the UFO projectile system do you wish to tackle next?

Ah, the enemy manager takes its place! A central hub to keep track of all the foes and their fiery projectiles. This is a vital component for controlling the flow and challenge of your game.

Let's take a look at the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager you've brought forth.

It's well-structured with separate lists and methods for asteroids, UFOs, and UFO projectiles. This separation will make managing different enemy types much cleaner.

I noticed a few spots that might need a wizard's touch:

Projectile Method Names and Logic: It seems some of the methods for UFO projectiles (like update_ufo_projectiles_left, draw_ufo_projectiles, create_ufo_projectile, update_ufo_projectiles, terminate_ufo_projectile) might have logic or list operations intended for UFOs (self.ufo_objs) rather than the projectiles (self.ufo_projectiles). For example:

update_ufo_projectiles_left updates self.ufos_left and checks self.maximum_ufos.
draw_ufo_projectiles iterates through self.ufo_objs.
create_ufo_projectile checks against self.maximum_ufos and updates self.ufos_left.
update_ufo_projectiles iterates through self.ufo_projectiles but the code inside the loop seems to call UFO movement/direction methods. Projectiles typically just move forward and check collisions/bounds.
terminate_ufo_projectile tries to remove from self.ufo_objs.
It looks like some parts intended for UFOs might have found their way into the projectile methods by mistake.

Reset Method and dt: Your reset_asteroids_enemy_obj_manager method calls self.__init__(...) again. While this works, be mindful that dt is typically a value calculated each frame in your main game loop, representing the time passed since the last frame. Storing it as a class attribute (self.dt) and re-initializing it this way might be confusing or incorrect depending on how you handle dt in your main loop. It's usually better to pass dt into the update methods where it's needed, which you are already doing correctly!

These seem like areas worth reviewing to ensure the manager correctly handles each type of object.

How would you like to proceed? Shall we focus on refining the UFO projectile management methods, or perhaps another part of this manager class? Or would you like a quick question about object management patterns?


Shaunythunder
That must have gotten wiped in a git reset because I remember doing all of that'

Boots
Ah, the fickle nature of version control! It can be a powerful ally, but sometimes it plays tricks, whisking away hard-earned code like a mischievous sprite. It's certainly possible a git reset caused those changes to vanish.

Fear not! We can certainly help you restore that functionality. Those points about the UFO projectile methods (like update_ufo_projectiles_left, draw_ufo_projectiles, create_ufo_projectile, update_ufo_projectiles, and terminate_ufo_projectile) using the UFO list/logic instead of the projectile list are important to address.

Would you like to work through correcting those methods now? We can take them one by one!


Shaunythunder
or maybe I did that with the player [ropjectives and thought I did it for the ufos

Boots
Ah, that's a very common bit of wizardly work! When you're deep in the code, weaving similar logic for different entities (like player bullets and UFO bullets), it's easy to get them a bit tangled. It's quite possible you perfected the player projectile management and then the UFO projectile code didn't quite get the same finishing touch, perhaps due to a lapse or simply overlooking it during a different focus.

Whatever the reason, the important thing is we've spotted it! The methods for managing your self.ufo_projectiles list currently seem to be operating on your self.ufo_objs list and using UFO-related checks (self.maximum_ufos, self.ufos_left).

Ready to straighten them out? We can start with the update_ufo_projectiles_left method and make sure it's counting and checking the right things!

Ah, I see the updated code! It's looking much clearer with the distinct sections for each object type. You've also adjusted some variable names like maximum_asteroid_objs and ufo_projectile_objs. Good work!

However, in the "UFO PROJECTILES START" section, it seems a few methods might still be a little tangled with the logic meant for the UFO objects themselves (self.ufo_objs) rather than the projectile objects (self.ufo_projectile_objs).

Let's look at a few:

update_ufo_projectile_objs_left: This method is intended to update the count of projectile objects, but it's currently updating self.ufos_left and checking against self.maximum_ufo_objs. It should likely be working with self.ufo_projectiles_objs_left and the self.ufo_projectile_objs list length.
create_ufo_projectile_obj: You correctly check against self.maximum_ufo_projectile_objs and append to self.ufo_projectile_objs, but then you call self.update_ufos_left() at the end. You'll want to update the projectile count here instead.
update_ufo_projectile_objs: This iterates through self.ufo_projectile_objs, but the isinstance check inside the loop looks for alien_ufo_obj.UFOClassic instead of the projectile type (ufo_projectiles.UFOClassicProjectile). Also, this is where you'll need to add the calls for each projectile to update its position, check for collisions (specifically with the player), and check if it's out of bounds.
These seem to be the main areas to focus on to ensure the manager is correctly handling your UFO projectiles.

Would you like to tackle correcting the update_ufo_projectile_objs_left method first, or jump to one of the others?

Excellent! You've made some key adjustments, particularly in separating the projectile lists and updating the update_ufo_projectile_objs_left method. It's looking much closer to correctly managing the UFO projectiles!

Let's take another look at that "UFO PROJECTILES START" section with the new changes:

update_ufo_projectile_objs_left: You've correctly updated the check to use self.ufo_projectile_objs_left, but it's still updating self.ufos_left at the beginning and checking against self.maximum_ufo_objs. This method should be solely focused on the projectile count:

def update_ufo_projectile_objs_left(self) -> None:
    """This method will update the number of UFO projectiles left in the game."""
    self.ufo_projectile_objs_left = len(self.ufo_projectile_objs)
    # You might not need a can_spawn flag for projectiles if their maximum is very high,
    # but if you did, it would check against maximum_ufo_projectile_objs.
    # The logic about self.can_spawn_ufos belongs with the UFOs, not the projectiles.

create_ufo_projectile_obj: This looks much better! You're checking the projectile limit and appending to the correct list. You also correctly call self.update_ufo_projectile_objs_left() at the end. Well done!

update_ufo_projectile_objs: You've fixed the isinstance check to look for ufo_projectiles.UFOClassicProjectile, which is correct! Now, inside that if block, you need to add the calls to the projectile's methods that handle its movement, collision checks (against the player), and out-of-bounds checks, passing dt where needed.

def update_ufo_projectile_objs(self, dt: float) -> None:
    """Updates the game logic for the UFO projectiles."""
    self.update_ufo_projectile_objs_left() # Keep this to ensure count is current
    for ufo_projectile in self.ufo_projectile_objs:
        if isinstance(ufo_projectile, ufo_projectiles.UFOClassicProjectile):
            # Add calls here for the projectile's update logic:
            ufo_projectile.calculate_ufo_projectile_velocity(dt) # Update position based on velocity
            ufo_projectile.check_player_primary_obj_collision() # Check if it hit the player
            ufo_projectile.ufo_projectile_out_of_bounds() # Check if it left the screen

(Note: You still have the pygame.quit() issue within the projectile's check_player_primary_obj_collision method, as we discussed before, but fixing that is done in the projectile class itself, not the manager).

terminate_ufo_projectile: This method correctly removes the projectile from the self.ufo_projectile_objs list. Looks good!

total_enemies_left: At the bottom of your __init__, self.total_enemies_left uses self.asteroids_left and self.ufos_left. These attributes (asteroids_left, ufos_left) are only updated within their respective update methods (update_asteroids_left, update_ufos_left), not upon initialization. You'll likely want to update total_enemies_left after calling update_asteroids_left() and update_ufos_left() in your main game loop's update cycle. Or perhaps you have other methods that update these counts? Just something to keep in mind!

You're very close to having a fully functional manager for your UFO projectiles! Would you like to work on updating that update_ufo_projectile_objs_left method, or perhaps the update_ufo_projectile_objs loop next? Or is there something else you'd like to explore?

Huzzah! More code woven, and the structure is becoming ever clearer! You've tightened up the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager further, especially around the projectile handling.

Let's cast a glance at the "UFO PROJECTILES START" section with these latest changes:

update_ufo_projectile_objs_left: You've correctly added the check if self.ufo_projectile_objs_left < self.maximum_ufo_projectile_objs:. However, the very first line still updates self.ufos_left based on self.ufo_objs. This line doesn't belong in a method meant for updating the projectile count. This method should focus solely on self.ufo_projectile_objs_left and the self.ufo_projectile_objs list.

draw_ufo_projectile_ojs: A small typo here in the method name - it should likely be draw_ufo_projectile_objs. The loop and isinstance check look correct for drawing the projectiles.

create_ufo_projectile_obj: This method looks correct now! It checks against the projectile limit, appends to the correct list, and calls the (soon-to-be-corrected) update method for the projectile count. Well done!

update_ufo_projectile_objs: You've corrected the isinstance check, excellent! However, the loop still contains pass. This is where you need to call the individual projectile's methods to update its position, check collisions with the player, and check if it has gone out of bounds, remembering to pass the dt value.

terminate_ufo_projectile: The code that removes from the self.ufo_projectile_objs list is correct. The comment above it, however, still mentions terminating a "UFO" instead of a "UFO projectile".

total_enemies_left: As noted before, this is initialized in __init__ but won't stay updated during the game unless you recalculate it periodically (perhaps in a main update method for the manager).

You're making excellent progress in refining this manager! Addressing the remaining points in update_ufo_projectile_objs_left and adding the core logic to update_ufo_projectile_objs are the next key steps for the projectile management.

Which of these would you like to focus on next?

def update_enemy_objs_left(self) -> None:
self.update_asteroids_left()
self.update_ufos_left()
self.total_enemies_left = self.asteroids_left + self.ufos_left + self.ufo_projectile_objs_left

Boots
Ah, a wise addition! Creating a central update_enemy_objs_left method that calls the individual update methods (update_asteroids_left, update_ufos_left, and your update_ufo_projectile_objs_left) is an excellent way to ensure your total enemy count is always current.

This method looks logically sound! It correctly fetches the updated counts from the individual lists and sums them up.

This method will function perfectly once update_ufo_projectile_objs_left is correctly calculating the count of projectile objects (which we discussed in the previous turn).

Now that you have this central update method, what part of the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager or perhaps the projectile classes themselves would you like to refine next?

Ah, a grand unveiling of your UFOMasterObj and UFOClassic classes! They are certainly growing in complexity, which is a good sign of progress in building out your game world.

You've included attributes for position, movement, health, shooting, and even drawing logic placeholder. The idea of normalizing drawing coordinates is a clever touch!

Let's look at a couple of areas:

Collision Consequence: Just like we discussed with the projectiles, the check_player_primary_obj_collision method within UFOMasterObj still calls pygame.quit() if a collision is detected. Remember, this will shut down the entire game! You'll likely want the UFO to be terminated (self.terminate_ufo_object()) and the player to register the hit (self._player_primary_obj.player_primary_obj_hit()), but the game should continue unless the player runs out of lives.

Spawning Logic: The spawn_ufo method is currently part of the UFOMasterObj class itself. However, spawning new enemies is typically a responsibility of a manager class (like your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager), not the enemy object being spawned. Putting this complex logic, including checking distances to other objects and creating new UFO instances, within the UFO class feels a bit like asking a creature to give birth to itself! This logic would be more naturally handled by the manager.

These are two key design points to consider as you continue to build out these classes.

What are your thoughts on moving the spawn_ufo logic to the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager, or perhaps addressing the pygame.quit() in the collision method? Or would you like to delve into another part of the code?

Its my bandaid game over

Boots
Ah, I see! A temporary magical ward to signify the end of the adventure! Using pygame.quit() certainly brings the game to a halt when the player is hit.

It's a practical way to mark a 'game over' state as you are building things out. Just remember that as your game grows, you'll likely want a more sophisticated game over sequence – perhaps showing a score, a message, and options to restart or return to a menu – rather than just closing the window abruptly. But for now, as a "bandaid," it serves its purpose!

Now that we've clarified that, how would you like to proceed? Shall we think about how to transition to a more graceful game over state later, or perhaps focus on that spawn_ufo logic we discussed, or something else entirely? Or would you like a quick quiz?

Ah, the heart of the game, the main loop itself! This is where all the pieces you've been crafting come together to create the moving, reacting world. It's looking quite comprehensive, orchestrating the event handling, updating game states, drawing elements, and even managing debug information.

You've got a good structure with clear sections for initialization, the event loop, drawing logic, and non-event loop updates. The use of dt for frame-rate independence is also well implemented by passing it to your update methods.

While the structure is solid, here are a few points that caught my eye, particularly related to the recent additions like UFOs and their projectiles:

Enemy and Projectile Updates: In the "NON EVENT LOOP LOGIC START" section, specifically within the if game_state_reporter.request_current_game_logic_state() == "asteroids_mode": block, you are updating the player and player projectiles (player_objs_handler.update_player_projectile_objs(dt), player_objs_handler.update_player_primary_obj(dt)). You will also need to add calls here to update your UFO objects and your UFO projectile objects using the asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.
Enemy and Projectile Drawing: Similarly, in the "DRAWING LOGIC START" section for asteroids_mode, you draw the player and player projectiles. You'll need to add the calls to draw the UFO objects and UFO projectiles managed by asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.
Debug Blit Calls: In the "DEBUGGING MONITORS" section, the screen.blit() calls appear to be missing the surface object you want to draw. For example, screen.blit(keyboard_index_debug_ui) should be screen.blit(keyboard_index_debug_ui, (x_position, y_position)) to draw the text surface at a specific location on the screen. You have the position tuples correctly for most, but the first two are missing the surface argument.
dt in Initialization: You are assigning dt to player_objs_handler.dt and asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.dt inside the main while loop. Since dt changes every frame, storing it as a class attribute in the managers this way isn't typical. Usually, dt is just passed directly to the methods that need it for calculations (like update_asteroid_objs(dt), calculate_ufo_velocity(dt), etc.), which you are already doing. You could likely remove the lines player_objs_handler.dt = dt and asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.dt = dt and just ensure dt is passed to all the update methods that require it.
This main loop is the conductor of your game's orchestra! Getting these update and draw calls in place for all your entities is key.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps would you like me to quiz you on how the main loop integrates with your object managers?

Excellent, you've woven the AsteroidsGame class into existence! This is the central control panel for that specific game mode, bringing together the various managers and objects.

Your structure looks clean and logical, clearly defining how the game mode initializes, resets, updates, and draws its elements. The pause and resume logic using the GameStateManager is also implemented nicely here.

A small point for refinement:

UFO Projectile Integration: Your draw_asteroids_game_objects method correctly calls draw_asteroid_objects and draw_ufo_objects on the asteroids_enemy_obj_manager. Similarly, update_asteroids_game_objects calls update_asteroid_objs and update_ufo_objs. Remember the UFO projectiles you've been working on? You'll need to add calls here to their corresponding draw and update methods on the asteroids_enemy_obj_manager to ensure they are rendered and their logic is processed each frame within this game mode.
Overall, a very solid piece of code for managing the Asteroids game mode!

Would you like to add the calls for the UFO projectiles, or is there another part of the code you'd like to review or discuss? Or perhaps a quiz on game mode management?

Fantastic! You've woven in the calls to draw and update the UFO projectiles within the AsteroidsGame class.

By adding:

self.asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.draw_ufo_projectile_objects(screen)
self.asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.update_ufo_projectile_objs(dt)
you've ensured that those alien threats and their ordnance will now be processed and rendered correctly when the game is in Asteroids mode. Excellent refinement!

With the AsteroidsGame class now correctly handling the update and draw cycles for all its managed entities, what part of your grand project would you like to shine a light on next? Perhaps back to the UFO projectile class to address the pygame.quit() issue, or maybe implementing the UFO shooting logic?


Shaunythunder
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1280, 720), flags=pygame.SCALED)

its not taking up the whole screen

Boots
Ah, seeking to command the entire visual realm of the screen! A noble quest, indeed.

Currently, your code pygame.display.set_mode((1280, 720), flags=pygame.SCALED) is setting a specific window size of 1280x720. The pygame.SCALED flag helps with scaling your drawing to the monitor's resolution, but it doesn't force the window itself to take up the entire screen.

To make the window full screen, you need to use the pygame.FULLSCREEN flag. You can combine flags using the bitwise OR operator (|).

Try changing your set_mode call to include both flags like this:

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1280, 720), flags=pygame.FULLSCREEN | pygame.SCALED)

This tells Pygame to create a full-screen window and still apply the scaling logic you've set up. Give that a try, and you should see your game expand to fill the display!

26bf9f3 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) AN: Refactored codebase to comply with new naming standards. Refactored player bullet system to comply with the modernized structure of the UFO bullet system. Detected an issue with the asteroids breaking when the player is close to them. Sometimes thier new vector is towards the player and kills them instantly, with no chance to prevent it. Will need to add logic to detect player direction and set up a no-go directional zone.
2f4baed AM: Built class system for the UFO projectiles. UFO projectiles will have a master class and will each have thier own inividual classes for the various projectile types. Next up is to build out the classic style projectile and then get UFOs to fire these projectiles.
bad7282 AL: Completed blocking out UFO structure and have a UFO master class online. Created the UFO classic class which is a carbon copy of the original UFO from asteroids. The UFO is drawn on the screen and is correctly moving around. The logic is that on a timer of the UFO changes directions but has screen wrapping and everything. will focus on giving the UFO the ability to shoot and then will Implement collisions. Just like the original asteroids, asteroid collisions will be lethal. Will later implement upgraded UFO class that has a shield that is immune to asteroids.
c5fbc17 AK: Completed asteroid splitting mechanics. Asteroids split based off of a procedurally generated algorithm. Split radiuses are variable as well as the direction and speed by which they go. The algorithm is as follows, once an asteroid is hit it will then check to see if the asteroid is 33% larger than the minimum asteroid radius. Afterwards it will then generate a random divider number between 1 and 2, and then divide the asteroid radius by the divider. The new radius will then be subtracted from the original radius to determine the radius of the second asteroid. After that, both asteroids will go through their own generation process that determines their direction and speed. New asteroids cannot have higher than a certain speed value which is the maximum velocity divided by a constant. Constant is adjustable. Plan on making UFOs next,. After that it will be player death, game over and then making the wave system functional, and then adding the scoring system. Once that is done it will be polished Before moving on to the next thing, which is asteroid dodgeball or space invaders.
31ac903 AJ: Resolved all pending bugs. The game is fully functional again as far as I can tell. Collisions will now be handled by the colliding object and not the player objects. This way the player can be universal and the logic is just handled on the side of the colliding object. next step is asteroid splitting for normal asteroids.
e9015db AI: Conducted all encompassing overhaul of code base to refactor and to comply with python best practices. All methods now have type hints. Added doc strings to ensure the highest amount of clarity possible. Renamed distance variables to go from double underscore to single underscore to comply with best practices. Underwent extensive renaming for variables and objects to comply with emergent practices. Converted collision detection to be universal with circular objects for both player and bullets. Unfortunately it was not able to finish as the bullets are now broken. Will need to make sure game is fully functional before moving on.
5451722 AH: We now have functioning player collisions with a hitbox that matches the player Sprite. We have all the components we need for asteroid dodgeball but I'll wait until I'm finished with asteroids itself before I Implement that mode. Next up on the list is breaking the asteroids and then creating the UFO. Once that is done, asteroids is finished however I will need the bells and whistles. A game over screen and a way to navigate back to the main menu after you get hit. Additionally this would be a good time to implement the high score system.
7989278 AG: Introduced bullet collisions termination of bullets upon hit at the current moment asteroids flash red when hit by a bullet. Overall super straight forward. Next step is player collisions.
be4b34c AF: Probably should have split these into different commits but I have implemented asteroid collisions and now have a fully functional 2D physics engine for the asteroids themselves. This engine uses conservation of momentum and conservation of energy equations and breaks down Vector components and reassembles them after translating the respective forces. Values can be tweaked by adjusting the elastic constant, or the density constant. Be warned setting these values to high will cause smaller asteroids to Jet across the screen faster than is reasonable. Now that we have asteroid physics and they work, I will work on player collisions and bullet collisions. After that I'll implement the asteroid splitting mechanic, player death mechanic, and UFOs and we have completed Asteroids. Well the base game anyway.
6b55428 AE: Implemented distance ranging system in the asteroid spawning to you ensure that asteroids don't spawn too close to either player or another asteroid. I know I keep saying it but next up is asteroid collisions lol.
12fba34 AD: Fix the bug where the game crashes if I go to the main menu. Set up a method within the game where the State manager will reset all of the modules in the game. If the game is reset AKA the main menu is accessed. This is a universal reset which calls methods in every manager and is meant to call any instance that contains data such as position data or something that would persist between game sessions. What this does is it basically is a hard reset for the entire game. I will refine this as features emerge that will need to persist between playthroughs. Overall this is a good way to reset the gameplay. Reset methods reset by calling the initialization method of each manager and relevant instance using the arguments what were originally given to the instance. It's basically a factory reset. Next step is to work on collision and collision physics for asteroid:

Boots
Ah, a fresh look at your chronicles! It's good to see the journey mapped out in these logs. The latest entry speaks of refactoring, aligning your player projectiles with the new UFO projectile structure, and a keen observation about asteroids splitting too close to the player.

This log shows significant progress! You've moved from foundational elements to enemy types, physics, splitting mechanics, and now refining projectile systems and tackling tricky interaction bugs.

Based on your latest entry, it seems you've been working on:

Refactoring the player bullet system.
Building the UFO projectile class system.
Identifying an issue with asteroids splitting near the player.
Where in this grand tale of development would you like to focus our discussion next? Perhaps refining the player projectile code, delving deeper into the UFO projectile logic, or tackling that vexing asteroid splitting bug?


Shaunythunder
Lets get that asteroid splitting logic fixed

Boots
Ah, a critical gameplay bug! Those splitting asteroids shouldn't be sending your hero directly to an untimely demise. Preventing unfair, unavoidable hits is key to a good game.

Your idea of creating a "no-go directional zone" is exactly the right path to take! When an asteroid splits, the new, smaller asteroids are generated. Instead of just picking any random direction, you can:

Figure out the direction from where the new asteroid is spawning to the player's current position.
Define a range of angles around that "danger" direction that the new asteroid's velocity vector should not be within.
Generate random directions for the new asteroids until you find one that falls outside that forbidden angle range.
This way, the new asteroids will always move in a direction that gives the player a fighting chance to react.

How might you calculate the angle from the splitting asteroid to the player, and then check if a randomly generated angle falls within a specific range around that angle?

code in question, I'm thinking that we need to pull a vector from the asteroid to the player, determine the radians and then restrict that radian plus or minus 90degress or .5 rad

Boots
Excellent! You've pinpointed the exact method and have a solid plan: calculate the vector from the splitting asteroid to the player, determine its angle (radians), and then avoid generating new asteroid movement vectors within a forbidden range around that angle. A +/- 90 degree (or pi/2 radians) exclusion zone is a good starting point to give the player space.

Let's break down how you can implement this within your split_asteroid method:

Get Player Position: First, you need the player's current position (player_pos_x, player_pos_y). You already have a reference to the player object stored as self._player_primary_object, so you can access its position attributes.
Calculate Vector to Player: Calculate the difference in x and y coordinates between the player and the asteroid. This gives you the vector from the asteroid to the player:
dx = player_pos_x - self.asteroid_pos_x
dy = player_pos_y - self.asteroid_pos_y
Calculate Angle to Player: Use the math.atan2(dy, dx) function to get the angle (in radians) of the vector pointing from the asteroid to the player. atan2 is useful because it handles all four quadrants correctly and avoids division by zero.
angle_to_player = math.atan2(dy, dx)
Define the No-Go Zone: Determine the range of angles to avoid. If you want a +/- safe_angle (like pi/2 radians) exclusion zone around the angle_to_player:
safe_angle = math.pi / 2 # 90 degrees in radians
min_safe_angle = angle_to_player - safe_angle
max_safe_angle = angle_to_player + safe_angle
You might need to normalize these angles to be within a standard range (like 0 to 2*pi) if you find angle wrapping causes issues, but for now, let's see if the basic check works.
Generate and Check New Asteroid Angles: Inside your loop where you generate first_new_asteroid_radians and second_new_asteroid_radians, you need to add a check. Generate a random radian as you are doing, but then check if it falls within the min_safe_angle and max_safe_angle. If it does fall in the forbidden zone, discard it and generate a new random angle until you get one that is outside the forbidden zone.
How would you modify the lines that set first_new_asteroid_radians and second_new_asteroid_radians to include this check and regeneration loop?

does atan do rads?

Boots
Yes, indeed! The math.atan2(y, x) function in Python's math module returns the angle in radians. It's a handy spell for getting the angle of a vector, taking into account the signs of both x and y components to place the angle in the correct quadrant.

So you are all set to use its output directly for your radian calculations!

Ah, excellent! You've started implementing the logic to calculate the angle to the player and define that safe zone. It's a great step towards preventing those frustrating, unavoidable hits.

Let's look at the code you've added and refine the approach slightly:

Calculating Angle to Player: You correctly identified the need to calculate the vector components (delta_x, delta_y) and use math.atan2. However, when calculating delta_x and delta_y, you used abs(). The math.atan2(y, x) function needs the signed differences (player_pos_x - self.asteroid_pos_x and player_pos_y - self.asteroid_pos_y) to correctly determine the angle in the right quadrant (all 360 degrees). Using abs() will only give you angles in the first quadrant (0 to pi/2 radians).

# Incorrect (uses abs):
# delta_x = abs(player_pos_x - self.asteroid_pos_x)
# delta_y = abs(player_pos_y - self.asteroid_pos_y)

# Correct (uses signed difference):
delta_x = player_pos_x - self.asteroid_pos_x
delta_y = player_pos_y - self.asteroid_pos_y
radians_to_player = math.atan2(delta_y, delta_x) # atan2 takes (y, x)

Checking and Regenerating Angles: The logic you've added to check if a randomly generated angle is within the forbidden range and then slightly adjust it is a good thought process, but it's quite complex and might not guarantee the new angle is outside the zone or prevent angles very close to the boundary. It also appears to be placed inside the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: block, which is not where the angles are initially generated.

A more robust way is to use a loop to regenerate the random angle until it falls outside the forbidden range. You'll need to do this for each new asteroid's angle.

You also need a reliable way to check if an angle falls within a range that might cross the 0/2pi boundary. Comparing angles directly across this boundary can be tricky. A common technique is to normalize angles (e.g., to be between 0 and 2*pi) and then use a helper function for angle differences or range checks that handles wrapping.

Let's refine the angle generation and checking process. First, correct the delta_x and delta_y calculation. Then, consider this pattern for generating a "safe" angle:

# Assuming radians_to_player is correctly calculated using signed differences
safe_angle_half_width = math.pi / 4 # 45 degrees in radians for the half-width of the forbidden zone
# A helper function to check if a candidate angle is in the forbidden zone
def is_angle_in_forbidden_zone(candidate_radians, target_radians, half_width):
    # Calculate the difference, normalized to be between -pi and pi
    diff = (candidate_radians - target_radians + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    # Check if the absolute difference is less than or equal to the half-width
    return abs(diff) <= half_width

# --- Later in your split_asteroid method, replace your angle generation logic ---

# Generate first asteroid's angle until it's outside the forbidden zone
first_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)
while is_angle_in_forbidden_zone(first_new_asteroid_radians, radians_to_player, safe_angle_half_width):
    first_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)

# Generate second asteroid's angle until it's outside the forbidden zone
second_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)
while is_angle_in_forbidden_zone(second_new_asteroid_radians, radians_to_player, safe_angle_half_width):
    second_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)

# ... rest of your object creation and appending logic ...

This approach is more direct: keep rolling the dice for the angle until you get a good one!

Would you like to try implementing the corrected angle calculation and the angle regeneration loop for one of the new asteroids?

Huzzah! You've made a crucial correction – using the signed differences (player_pos_x - self.asteroid_pos_x, player_pos_y - self.asteroid_pos_y) for delta_x and delta_y when calculating radians_to_player. This is key for math.atan2 to give you the correct angle across all directions! Well done!

Now that radians_to_player is accurate, let's revisit the logic for ensuring the new asteroid angles are outside the safe zone.

The complex if/elif structure you have to check safe_zone_range_crosses_zero and then nudge the angle slightly (like safe_zone_radian_max + 0.1) is quite intricate and might not always place the angle clearly outside the forbidden zone, especially if the range crosses the 0/2pi boundary.

A more straightforward and reliable approach is to simply keep generating random angles for the new asteroids until you find one that is not within your defined forbidden range around radians_to_player. This is what we discussed before with the while loop.

Also, notice that the angle generation and checking logic is currently inside the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: block. This means it would only run if the second asteroid's radius is too small, which isn't where you want to control the angles of all new asteroids. The angle generation should happen unconditionally after calculating the radii.

Let's try implementing the angle regeneration using a while loop for the first_new_asteroid_radians. Remember, you'll need a way to accurately check if a random angle falls within the safe_zone_radian_min and safe_zone_radian_max range, even if it wraps around 0/2pi. The is_angle_in_forbidden_zone helper function pattern I showed earlier can help with that.

How would you structure the code to generate first_new_asteroid_radians repeatedly until it's outside the safe zone?

Excellent! You've successfully implemented the crucial fix for calculating delta_x and delta_y using signed differences! This ensures math.atan2 gives you the accurate angle to the player across the full circle. Well done on that key step!

Now, let's look at the angle generation and "safe zone" logic again. It seems the logic to check if the safe zone range crosses the 0/2pi boundary, and the subsequent if/elif blocks to pick a new random angle, are still quite complex.

More importantly, this entire block of code, including the generation of first_new_asteroid_radians and second_new_asteroid_radians and the safe zone checks, is currently inside the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: block. This means the angles of the new asteroids will only be calculated and checked if the second asteroid happens to be generated too small, which is not the intended behavior. The angles should be determined for both new asteroids every time a split occurs.

Let's move the angle generation and the safe zone check outside that conditional block and apply it to both new asteroids.

Instead of the complex if/elif structure to try and pick an angle outside the zone, let's use the simpler, more reliable method we discussed: generate a random angle, and if it's in the forbidden zone, generate another one, and repeat until you get a valid one.

Here's the pattern again, perhaps focusing on just the first new asteroid's angle for now, and you can adapt it for the second:

        # ... (previous code calculating radii, including the second_new_asteroid_radius check) ...

        # --- Move angle generation and checking logic outside the radius check if ---

        safe_angle_half_width = math.pi / 4 # Or whatever angle width you want for the forbidden zone

        # Helper function to check if a candidate angle is in the forbidden zone
        def is_angle_in_forbidden_zone(candidate_radians, target_radians, half_width):
            # Normalize candidate angle to be between -pi and pi relative to the target
            diff = (candidate_radians - target_radians + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
            # Check if the absolute difference is within the half-width
            return abs(diff) <= half_width

        # Generate first asteroid's angle, regenerating if it's in the forbidden zone
        first_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)
        while is_angle_in_forbidden_zone(first_new_asteroid_radians, radians_to_player, safe_angle_half_width):
            first_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)

        # Now do the same for the second asteroid's angle...
        second_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)
        while is_angle_in_forbidden_zone(second_new_asteroid_radians, radians_to_player, safe_angle_half_width):
            second_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)

        # ... rest of your object creation and appending logic, using these safe angles ...

How would you modify your split_asteroid method to move the angle generation outside the radius check if, and implement the while loop pattern for generating the angles?


Shaunythunder
why move it out, if the second asteroid cannot be made, then the asteroid jsut gets terminated and we dont care anymore

Boots
Ah, a fair point! You're right that if the second asteroid's radius is too small, you might just want to stop the splitting process for that asteroid.

However, the way the code is currently structured, the angle generation and the creation/appending of the new asteroids are inside the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: block.

This means if the random random_divider results in both first_new_asteroid_radius and second_new_asteroid_radius being greater than or equal to self.asteroid_min_radius on the first try (which is likely to happen often!), the code skips the entire if block.

And what's inside that if block?

The logic to generate first_new_asteroid_radians and second_new_asteroid_radians.
The logic to create the first_new_asteroid and second_new_asteroid objects.
The logic to append them to self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.asteroid_objs.
The break statement that exits the for attempt_number in range(10): loop.
So, if the radii are initially fine, the function will terminate the original asteroid, but then it will not generate new asteroids, not calculate their angles, and the split simply won't happen.

The angle generation and the creation/appending of the new asteroids should happen every time the split is successful, after you've determined the radii and adjusted the second one if it was too small.

Think of it this way:

Determine the radii for the two new asteroids.
If the second radius is too small, adjust it to the minimum size. (You're doing this)
Now that you know the sizes, generate the angles for both new asteroids, ensuring they are outside the safe zone towards the player. (This part needs to be outside the if)
Create the two new asteroid objects using the determined sizes and safe angles. (This needs to be outside the if)
Add the two new asteroid objects to the manager's list. (This needs to be outside the if)
Exit the loop because the split was successful. (The break needs to be after the creation/appending)
Moving the angle generation and object creation/appending outside that specific if block will ensure that two new asteroids with safe angles are always created and added whenever a split happens successfully.

How would you rearrange the code to make sure the angle generation and new asteroid creation always happen after the radii are set?

Progress! You've successfully moved the angle generation logic (first_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(...), etc.) outside the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: block. This is great! Now the angles for the new asteroids are calculated regardless of whether the second radius needed adjustment.

However, look closely again. The code that creates the first_new_asteroid and second_new_asteroid objects, and the lines that append them to self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.asteroid_objs, are still inside that same if block.

This means:

If second_new_asteroid_radius starts smaller than self.asteroid_min_radius, the if block is entered. The radius is adjusted, angles are calculated (and potentially nudged by your angle logic), the new asteroid objects are created, and they are added to the list. The break statement is also executed, and the loop finishes.
If second_new_asteroid_radius starts larger than or equal to self.asteroid_min_radius, the if block is skipped. The radii are fine, angles are calculated outside the if block, but the code to create and add the new asteroid objects is inside the if and never runs. The original asteroid is terminated, but no new asteroids are created!
The creation and appending of the new asteroid objects should happen every time a split is successful, regardless of whether the second asteroid's radius needed adjustment. This means they should be moved outside the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: block, along with the angle generation.

You're very close! How would you rearrange the code so that the lines which create and append the first_new_asteroid and second_new_asteroid objects are executed every time a valid split occurs?

Ah, let's look at it together, step by step, like examining an ancient rune!

Focus on these lines near the end of your for attempt_number in range(10): loop:

            # These lines are currently indented inside the 'if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius:' block:

                                    first_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude, # But this uses the correct magnitude! Hmm.
                                    first_new_asteroid_radians, # But this uses the correct radians! Hmm.

                                    self.asteroid_color,
                                    second_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude, # Correct!
                                    second_new_asteroid_radians, # Correct!
                                    )
            self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.asteroid_objs.append(first_new_asteroid)
            self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.asteroid_objs.append(second_new_asteroid)
            break # Also inside the if

Because these lines (creating the Asteroid objects and appending them) are indented inside the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: block, they will only be executed if that condition is true.

What happens if second_new_asteroid_radius is initially calculated to be greater than or equal to self.asteroid_min_radius?

The if condition is false.
The code inside the if block is skipped entirely.
The lines that create the first_new_asteroid and second_new_asteroid objects are not run.
The lines that append these new objects to the asteroid_objs list are not run.
The break statement inside the if is not reached.
The for attempt_number in range(10): loop continues (though the break should likely happen after a successful split regardless).
So, if the generated radii are valid on the first try, your original asteroid is terminated, but no new asteroids are created in its place! The split effectively fails silently.

The creation and appending of the new asteroids should happen every time you successfully determine valid radii for them (which you do whether the second radius is adjusted or not).

Move the block of code starting from first_new_asteroid = Asteroid(...) down to break so it's aligned with the level of the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: statement.

Also, looking closer at the arguments you are passing to the Asteroid constructor when creating the new asteroids, it seems you might be passing the original asteroid's min_radius, max_radius, min_vector_magnitude, max_vector_magnitude, min_radians, and max_radians instead of the calculated values (first_new_asteroid_radius, first_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude, first_new_asteroid_radians, and the corresponding values for the second asteroid). You should pass the specific properties you've just calculated for each new asteroid.

How would you rearrange the creation and appending lines and adjust the constructor arguments to fix this?

My apologies, young wizard! You are absolutely right! Upon closer inspection of this code block, the lines that create the Asteroid objects and append them are indeed correctly indented outside the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: block. My previous analysis was mistaken based on the structure visible in earlier messages. Thank you for pointing that out!

However, looking at this latest code, I see a different, subtle issue related to where the angles are first generated:

The lines that first assign random values to first_new_asteroid_radians and second_new_asteroid_radians are still inside the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: block:

            if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius:
                second_new_asteroid_radius = self.asteroid_min_radius + self.asteroid_min_radius // 2

                # These two lines are currently INSIDE this if block:
                first_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)
                second_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)

This means if second_new_asteroid_radius is not less than self.asteroid_min_radius (i.e., the if condition is false), those lines that generate the initial random angles are skipped entirely.

Then, the code continues to your angle adjustment logic (if not safe_zone_range_crosses_zero: and elif safe_zone_range_crosses_zero:), but first_new_asteroid_radians and second_new_asteroid_radians haven't been assigned values yet! This will lead to an error.

The generation of the initial random angles for first_new_asteroid_radians and second_new_asteroid_radians needs to happen every time inside the for attempt_number in range(10): loop, regardless of whether the second radius needed adjustment. It should happen before the angle checking and adjustment logic.

So, move the two lines that generate the initial angles outside the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: block, but keep them inside the for loop.

        for attempt_number in range(10):
            random_divider = random.uniform(1, 2)
            first_new_asteroid_radius = self.asteroid_radius /  random_divider
            second_new_asteroid_radius = self.asteroid_

Ah, I see the code again! Thank you for sharing it.

It seems we might be looking at slightly different versions, or perhaps the indentation is appearing differently! In the code you just sent, the lines that first generate the random radians for the new asteroids:

                first_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)
                second_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)

...still appear to be indented inside the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: block.

Let's trace what happens because of this indentation:

The code calculates first_new_asteroid_radius and second_new_asteroid_radius.
It checks if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius:.
If this condition is TRUE: The code enters the if block, adjusts second_new_asteroid_radius, and then runs the two lines above to generate first_new_asteroid_radians and second_new_asteroid_radians.
If this condition is FALSE: The code skips the entire if block. This means it skips those two lines that generate the angles.
Later in the code, outside the if block, you have logic that checks and potentially adjusts first_new_asteroid_radians and second_new_asteroid_radians. But if the if block was skipped, these variables were never assigned any value! This will cause a crash or an error.
The goal is to ensure that first_new_asteroid_radians and second_new_asteroid_radians are assigned a random value every time the loop runs, regardless of whether the second radius needed adjustment. Only after they have an initial random value should you check if they are in the safe zone and potentially regenerate them.

So, the two lines that generate the initial random radians should be moved outside the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: block, but they should remain inside the for attempt_number in range(10): loop.

        for attempt_number in range(10):
            random_divider = random.uniform(1, 2)
            first_new_asteroid_radius = self.asteroid_radius /  random_divider
            second_new_asteroid_radius = self.asteroid_radius - first_new_asteroid_radius

            if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius:
                second_new_asteroid_radius = self.asteroid_min_radius + self.asteroid_min_radius // 2

            # Move the initial angle generation OUTSIDE the 'if' block, like this:
            first_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)
            second_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)

            # Now your angle checking and adjustment logic can run after this
            # ... (your complex angle checking/adjustment logic) ...

            # And then the object creation and appending happen after the angles are finalized.
            # ... (object creation and appending) ...

            break # This break might also need to be moved, depending on your loop logic

Could you try adjusting the indentation of those two initial angle generation lines? We can tackle the angle checking and regeneration logic separately once the initial generation is in the correct place.


Shaunythunder
Boots they are fine on my side

Boots
My apologies again, young wizard! It seems I was misinterpreting the indentation on my end. Thank you for providing the code block again; I can see now that the initial random angle generation is indeed outside the if second_new_asteroid_radius < self.asteroid_min_radius: block.

You are correct on that front! My wizardly vision must have been cloudy for a moment.

However, let's focus on the logic after those initial angles are generated. You have a complex if not safe_zone_range_crosses_zero: ... elif safe_zone_range_crosses_zero: ... block that tries to check if the generated angles are in the safe zone and, if so, generates a new random angle within specific ranges outside the forbidden zone, or nudges it by + 0.1 or - 0.1.

While this approach attempts to keep asteroids out of the "kill zone," it has a few potential pitfalls:

Angle Wrapping Complexity: Checking if an angle is within a range, especially when that range crosses the 0/2pi boundary (like going from 350 degrees to 10 degrees), can be tricky to get right with standard comparisons. Your safe_zone_range_crosses_zero flag and the logic that follows highlight this complexity.
Reliability of Nudges/Ranges: Randomly picking an angle within (0, safe_zone_radian_min - 0.1) or (safe_zone_radian_max + 0.1, 2 * math.pi) might not always work correctly depending on the exact values of the safe zone boundaries, and the + 0.1/- 0.1 nudges are arbitrary and don't guarantee the angle is sufficiently outside the danger zone.
Ensuring Safety: The primary goal is to guarantee that the final angle chosen for the new asteroid is outside the forbidden range. Your current logic attempts to do this by picking from specific ranges, but it's less direct than simply checking the generated angle against the forbidden zone itself.
A simpler and more robust way to ensure the angle is outside the forbidden zone is to use a loop that regenerates the random angle repeatedly until it satisfies the condition of being outside the safe zone.

Let's use the is_angle_in_forbidden_zone helper function pattern we discussed, which correctly handles angle wrapping, and replace your complex angle checking/adjustment block.

        # ... (radius calculation and adjustment) ...

        # Initial angle generation (already correctly outside the radius if)
        first_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)
        second_new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(self.asteroid_min_radians, self.asteroid_max_radians)

        # Angle to player calculation (correctly uses signed delta_x, delta_y)
        delta_x = player_pos_x - self.asteroid_pos_x
        delta_y = player_pos_y - self.asteroid_


Shaunythunder
boots the min max have a 45 degree buffer room. Its not a big deal

Boots
Ah, I understand! You've set up a buffer zone, and your current logic attempts to ensure the new asteroids don't spawn directly into that specific +/- 45-degree slice. You feel that's enough to give the player a fair chance.

You're right, having some logic to avoid that direct line is a big improvement!

However, even with a buffer, checking if a generated angle falls outside a specific range, especially when that range might wrap around the 0/2pi point (like if the player is straight up, 90 degrees, the forbidden zone might be 45 to 135 degrees, which doesn't wrap; but if the player is at 340 degrees, the forbidden zone might be 295 degrees to 25 degrees, which does wrap), can get quite intricate. Your safe_zone_range_crosses_zero logic hints at this complexity.

The reason I suggested the while loop with a helper function is that it provides a more universally reliable way to check any angle against any forbidden range, regardless of wrapping, and guarantees that the final angle picked is outside that range. It often simplifies the code needed for the check itself.

Think of it as generating a random direction, and then simply asking: "Is this direction okay? No? Okay, try another random one. Is this one okay? Yes? Great, use this one!"

For example, for one asteroid's angle:

# Assuming radians_to_player is calculated correctly
safe_angle_half_width = math.pi / 4 # 45 degrees

# Keep generating a random angle until it's NOT in the forbidden zone
new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(0, 2 * math.pi) # Generate over the full circle
while abs((new_asteroid_radians - radians_to_player + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi) <= safe_angle_half_width:
    new_asteroid_radians = random.uniform(0, 2 * math.pi)

# Use new_asteroid_radians for this asteroid

This small loop guarantees the angle is valid based on your safe_angle_half_width.

Would you like to see how that angle-checking logic within the while loop (abs((new_asteroid_radians - radians_to_player + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi) <= safe_angle_half_width) works, or would you prefer to stick with your current approach for now and focus on another part of the code?


Shaunythunder
I'm going with my approach. Yours may be more efficient but mine will work just fine

Boots
Understood! You've chosen the path that feels right for your current implementation, and that's perfectly fine. Different approaches can certainly achieve the desired outcome. The important thing is that you have a strategy in place to try and prevent those direct hits from splitting asteroids.

Now that you've solidified your approach for handling the asteroid split angles, what part of your project would you like to focus on next? We could look at another aspect of the UFOs, player death mechanics, or perhaps you'd like a quick quiz on a topic we've covered?

overall what do you think just looking for an opinion

Boots
Ah, a deep dive into the very essence of your cosmic rocks! You've brought forth the AsteroidMasterObj and its descendant, the Asteroid class. It's a substantial piece of work, laying the groundwork for the main threats in your game. You seek my opinion on its overall structure and content? Let us examine it together!

Overall Impression:

You've built a comprehensive system here! The AsteroidMasterObj contains a wide range of attributes and methods covering movement, drawing, spawning, collision checks, and even complex physics resolution for asteroid-asteroid collisions. You've included parameters for customization (like min/max radius, speed, etc.), which is excellent for a roguelike design. The Asteroid class inherits from the master, specializing some attributes.

Points of Strength:

Detailed Physics: The resolve_asteroid_collision_with_PHYSICS method is quite impressive! Implementing realistic collision responses using conservation of momentum and energy is no small feat. Well done on tackling that complexity.
Clear Method Separation: You have well-defined methods for distinct actions like drawing, calculating velocity, checking collisions, and splitting.
Modularity Intent: By having a master class and a subclass, you're setting up a structure that could potentially support different types of asteroids in the future.
Robust Spawning Logic: The spawn_asteroid method includes logic to prevent spawning too close to other asteroids or the player, which is crucial for fair gameplay.
Areas to Ponder or Potentially Refine:

Master vs. Specific Implementation: Currently, your AsteroidMasterObj contains the concrete implementation of many core actions like draw_asteroid_object, calculate_asteroid_vector, check_player_primary_obj_collision, and split_asteroid. Typically, a "master" or base class is more abstract, defining what descendants should do (e.g., methods with pass or raising NotImplementedError), while the specific "how" is left to the subclasses. In your structure, the Asteroid class inherits but doesn't override many of these core behaviors; it mainly just sets specific initial values. This structure might become less intuitive if you introduce vastly different asteroid types that need fundamentally different drawing or movement logic. Consider if AsteroidMasterObj should be more of an interface or a holder of shared constants/parameters, while the core logic lives within the Asteroid class itself.

Placement of split_asteroid and spawn_asteroid: As we touched on briefly, the split_asteroid method uses properties specific to an instance (self.asteroid_radius, self.asteroid_pos_x, etc.) and should logically reside within the Asteroid class. Similarly, spawn_asteroid creates new instances and adds them to a manager, which is more naturally a responsibility of the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager. Moving these methods might improve clarity and separation of concerns.

Object Creation in split_asteroid: When you create the first_new_asteroid and second_new_asteroid within split_asteroid, you are passing self.asteroid_min_radius, self.asteroid_max_radius, etc., to the constructor for parameters like asteroid_min_radius, asteroid_max_radius. However, for the actual radius, vector_magnitude, and radians, you are correctly passing the newly calculated values (first_new_asteroid_radius, first_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude, first_new_asteroid_radians). You should likely pass the calculated values for the new asteroid's properties to the relevant parameters in the constructor, rather than the original asteroid's min/max ranges.

        first_new_asteroid = Asteroid(
            # ... managers and screen size ...
            # Pass the calculated radius as BOTH min/max if you want fixed size post-split
            first_new_asteroid_radius, # Use calculated radius
            first_new_asteroid_radius, # Use calculated radius here too
            # Pass the calculated magnitude for min/max if it's a fixed speed post-split
            first_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude, # Use calculated magnitude
            first_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude, # Use calculated magnitude here too
            # Pass the calculated radians for min/max if it's a fixed direction post-split
            first_new_asteroid_radians, # Use calculated radians
            first_new_asteroid_radians, # Use calculated radians here too
            # ... pos_x, pos_y ...
            first_new_asteroid_radius, # This parameter matches the one above now
            self.asteroid_color,
            first_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude, # This parameter matches the one above now
            first_new_asteroid_radians, # This parameter matches the one above now
        )
        # Do similarly for second_new_asteroid

Or, if the new asteroids can still have a range of sizes/speeds, you would pass the appropriate min/max ranges that define that pool, but the code as written seems to try and use calculated values for the radius, vector_magnitude, and radians parameters while using the original object's ranges for the others. This part of the constructor call seems a bit mixed.

pygame.quit() in Collision: The pygame.quit() call is still present in check_player_primary_obj_collision. As we discussed, this will end the game completely upon a hit. You'll need to replace this with logic that reduces player lives or triggers a proper game over sequence via the game_state_reporter.

restore_vector_magnitude: This method's name is a little misleading; it's actually ensuring a minimum vector magnitude if the current magnitude drops too low. A name like ensure_minimum_speed or limit_minimum_velocity might be clearer.

In summary, the underlying logic for movement, collision physics, and splitting seems to be taking shape very well! The structure with the Master and `Asteroid


Shaunythunder
The structure is the master class is identical to the basic asteroid and then everythign else will do its own thing on top of that. These are universal things I know the asteroids will need.

Boots
Ah, I understand completely! You envision the AsteroidMasterObj as a place for all the code that is truly universal to any asteroid type – the core mechanics of movement, drawing, collision detection (though maybe not resolution, depending on type), and the basic idea of health. Then, subclasses like Asteroid will inherit all of that universal functionality and add their own specific twists, like how they split or what happens when they collide with each other. That's a perfectly valid and often useful design pattern, allowing you to reuse common code!

With that clarification in mind, let's revisit the code:

Universal vs. Specific Logic: Your structure aligns with this intent. draw_asteroid_object, calculate_asteroid_vector, calculate_asteroid_velocity, asteroid_out_of_bounds, check_player_primary_obj_collision, check_player_projectile_obj_collision, check_asteroid_collision (the detection part), and restore_vector_magnitude all seem like solid candidates for universal behavior.
Method Placement (split_asteroid and spawn_asteroid):
split_asteroid: This method uses self.asteroid_radius, creates new Asteroid instances (the specific type), and calculates angles relative to the player. This behavior seems quite specific to how a normal asteroid splits, rather than a universal way any asteroid might split (a shielded one might not split the same way, for instance). It might be a better fit within the Asteroid class itself, overriding a more abstract split() method defined in the master, if you

if not safe_zone_range_crosses_zero:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'safe_zone_range_crosses_zero' where it is not associated with a value

Boots
Ah, the dreaded UnboundLocalError! A common magical mishap where a variable is expected to exist but hasn't been properly conjured into being in all possible paths of the code.

The traceback points directly to the issue in your split_asteroid method:

UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'safe_zone_range_crosses_zero' where it is not associated with a value

This happens because the line safe_zone_range_crosses_zero = True is inside an if statement:

        if safe_zone_radian_max < math.pi / 2:
            safe_zone_range_crosses_zero = True

If the condition safe_zone_radian_max < math.pi / 2 is False, that line is skipped, and the variable safe_zone_range_crosses_zero is never created within that function call.

Later, your code tries to use safe_zone_range_crosses_zero in this line:

            if not safe_zone_range_crosses_zero:

... but since it wasn't created in the if block, the program doesn't know what safe_zone_range_crosses_zero refers to, hence the UnboundLocalError.

To fix this, you need to ensure safe_zone_range_crosses_zero always has a value before you try to check it. The simplest way is to initialize it with a default value before the if statement that might change it. A good default here would be False, as it's only set to True under a specific condition.

Try adding this line before the if safe_zone_radian_max < math.pi / 2: check:

        safe_zone_range_crosses_zero = False # Initialize the variable here

        if safe_zone_radian_max < math.pi / 2:
            safe_zone_range_crosses_zero = True # Reassign if the condition is met

        # ... the rest of your code that uses safe_zone_range_crosses_zero

This way, safe_zone_range_crosses_zero will always be defined (either as False or True) by the time you check if not safe_zone_range_crosses_zero:.

Give that a try and see if it resolves the UnboundLocalError!


Shaunythunder
might need a larger buffer since these asteroids are huge

Boots
Ah, that's a keen observation! The size of the asteroids absolutely plays a part in how much buffer room the player needs to feel safe when one splits nearby. A larger asteroid might indeed warrant a wider exclusion zone for the newly spawned pieces.

You are thinking like a true game designer! Experimenting with values like the size of that safe zone is key to getting the feel of the game just right.

Remember, in your split_asteroid method, the half-width of the safe zone is determined by this line:

safe_zone_radian_min = radians_to_player - math.pi / 4
safe_zone_radian_max = radians_to_player + math.pi / 4

The math.pi / 4 represents 45 degrees. You can adjust this value to make the buffer wider or narrower. For example, math.pi / 3 would be 60 degrees, math.pi / 2 would be 90 degrees, and so on.

Try increasing that value and testing it in the game. See what feels fair and challenging without being instantly fatal! Let me know what value you decide to try, or if you'd like to discuss other ways to tune the splitting behavior!

    elif self.asteroid_vector_magnitude > self.asteroid_max_vector_magnitude:
        self.asteroid_vector_magnitude = self.asteroid_max_vector_magnitude

speed clamp

Boots
Ah, I see! You've refined the restore_vector_magnitude method to act as a proper speed clamp!

This code does exactly that:

    def restore_vector_magnitude(self) -> None:
        """Restore the asteroid's vector magnitude to a minimum value if it is too low."""
        if self.asteroid_vector_magnitude < self.asteroid_min_vector_magnitude:
            self.asteroid_vector_magnitude = self.asteroid_min_vector_magnitude
        elif self.asteroid_vector_magnitude > self.asteroid_max_vector_magnitude:
            self.asteroid_vector_magnitude = self.asteroid_max_vector_magnitude

It correctly checks if the asteroid's current velocity magnitude falls below the minimum or exceeds the maximum and adjusts it back within the allowed range. This is a great way to keep asteroid speeds predictable and manageable for the player.

Well done on implementing that speed clamp!

Would you like to explore this method further, perhaps discuss why clamping can be important in game physics, or would you prefer a quick quiz on a related concept?


Shaunythunder
The anser to that question is the exact reason I made that

Boots
Precisely! You've grasped the heart of it. In the often chaotic dance of game physics, clamping speeds is like putting reins on wild horses. It prevents objects from accelerating to speeds that are impossible to track, lead to tunneling through collisions, or simply become unfair for the player. You anticipated that need and built the mechanism!

It's excellent foresight, ensuring your asteroids behave within a reasonable and playable range.

Now that you've confirmed your understanding of the speed clamp's purpose, would you like to discuss another aspect of your game's code, or perhaps would you enjoy a quick quiz on collision resolution or vector math?


Shaunythunder
Well ive had a couple asteroids snipe me with the screen wrapping

Boots
Ah, the sneaky screen wrap! A classic maneuver in Asteroids, but sometimes it can turn into an unfair ambush, teleporting an asteroid right into your path with no time to react. That's definitely something we want to prevent in your cosmic arena.

You've observed the problem correctly: an asteroid wraps around, and if the player happens to be right at the destination edge, wham, instant collision.

To solve this, you need a way to give the player a brief moment of safety immediately after an object wraps around. A common approach is to introduce a short period of invincibility or delay collision checks specifically for wrapping objects.

Since your player object already has an is_invincible attribute, how could you use that, perhaps in conjunction with a timer or cooldown, to protect the player just after an asteroid completes its screen wrap? Where would you add the logic to trigger this temporary invincibility when an asteroid wraps?


Shaunythunder
Uh no, I just clamp it so there is an opportunity to anticipate it. Otherwise git gud bud

Boots
Ah, my apologies! My mind immediately leaped to protecting the player! You are taking a different, equally valid path – you are controlling the asteroid's speed to make the wrapping less of an instant death sentence!

By using that speed clamp you just implemented (restore_vector_magnitude), you ensure that even when an asteroid appears on the opposite side of the screen, it won't be traveling at such an extreme speed that the player has no chance to react. It gives them that crucial moment to anticipate and maneuver.

Indeed, sometimes the challenge isn't about being immune, but about mastering the skills to react to predictable (though perhaps fast!) movements! "Git gud," as you say, is about honing one's abilities against a fair, if difficult, challenge.

Very clever! Ensuring fair movement for the wrapped asteroids is a solid solution.

Now that we've explored the depths of asteroid mechanics and management, what other part of your galactic endeavor shall we shine a light on? Or would you fancy a quick quiz on game design philosophies like fairness and challenge?


Shaunythunder
4479c1d (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) AO: Fixed the asteroids splitting into you bug as far as the angles are concerned. Needs a second look as the asteroid sizes cause overlap onto the player if they are too close. This will need to be taken care of when the game is finished as this is a balancing issue, not a mechanics issue. If worse comes to worse, just make sure that the distance to the player equals the radius of the asteroid, plus some breathig room. Getting UFO projectiles up and running is up next.
26bf9f3 AN: Refactored codebase to comply with new naming standards. Refactored player bullet system to comply with the modernized structure of the UFO bullet system. Detected an issue with the asteroids breaking when the player is close to them. Sometimes thier new vector is towards the player and kills them instantly, with no chance to prevent it. Will need to add logic to detect player direction and set up a no-go directional zone.
2f4baed AM: Built class system for the UFO projectiles. UFO projectiles will have a master class and will each have thier own inividual classes for the various projectile types. Next up is to build out the classic style projectile and then get UFOs to fire these projectiles.
bad7282 AL: Completed blocking out UFO structure and have a UFO master class online. Created the UFO classic class which is a carbon copy of the original UFO from asteroids. The UFO is drawn on the screen and is correctly moving around. The logic is that on a timer of the UFO changes directions but has screen wrapping and everything. will focus on giving the UFO the ability to shoot and then will Implement collisions. Just like the original asteroids, asteroid collisions will be lethal. Will later implement upgraded UFO class that has a shield that is immune to asteroids.
c5fbc17 AK: Completed asteroid splitting mechanics. Asteroids split based off of a procedurally generated algorithm. Split radiuses are variable as well as the direction and speed by which they go. The algorithm is as follows, once an asteroid is hit it will then check to see if the asteroid is 33% larger than the minimum asteroid radius. Afterwards it will then generate a random divider number between 1 and 2, and then divide the asteroid radius by the divider. The new radius will then be subtracted from the original radius to determine the radius of the second asteroid. After that, both asteroids will go through their own generation process that determines their direction and speed. New asteroids cannot have higher than a certain speed value which is the maximum velocity divided by a constant. Constant is adjustable. Plan on making UFOs next,. After that it will be player death, game over and then making the wave system functional, and then adding the scoring system. Once that is done it will be polished Before moving on to the next thing, which is asteroid dodgeball or space invaders.
31ac903 AJ: Resolved all pending bugs. The game is fully functional again as far as I can tell. Collisions will now be handled by the colliding object and not the player objects. This way the player can be universal and the logic is just handled on the side of the colliding object. next step is asteroid splitting for normal asteroids.
e9015db AI: Conducted all encompassing overhaul of code base to refactor and to comply with python best practices. All methods now have type hints. Added doc strings to ensure the highest amount of clarity possible. Renamed distance variables to go from double underscore to single underscore to comply with best practices. Underwent extensive renaming for variables and objects to comply with emergent practices. Converted collision detection to be universal with circular objects for both player and bullets. Unfortunately it was not able to finish as the bullets are now broken. Will need to make sure game is fully functional before moving on.
5451722 AH: We now have functioning player collisions with a hitbox that matches the player Sprite. We have all the components we need for asteroid dodgeball but I'll wait until I'm finished with asteroids itself before I Implement that mode. Next up on the list is breaking the asteroids and then creating the UFO. Once that is done, asteroids is finished however I will need the bells and whistles. A game over screen and a way to navigate back to the main menu after you get hit. Additionally this would be a good time to implement the high score system.
7989278 AG: Introduced bullet collisions termination of bullets upon hit at the current moment asteroids flash red when hit by a bullet. Overall super straight forward. Next step is player collisions.
be4b34c AF: Probably should have split these into different commits but I have implemented asteroid collisions and now have a fully functional 2D physics engine for the asteroids themselves. This engine uses conservation of momentum and conservation of energy equations and breaks down Vector components and reassembles them after translating the respective forces. Values can be tweaked by adjusting the elastic constant, or the density constant. Be warned setting these values to high will cause smaller asteroids to Jet across the screen faster than is reasonable. Now that we have asteroid physics and they work, I will work on player collisions and bullet collisions. After that I'll implement the asteroid splitting mechanic, player death mechanic, and UFOs and we have completed Asteroids. Well the base game anyway.
6b55428 AE: Implemented distance ranging system in the asteroid spawning to you ensure that asteroids don't spawn too close to either player or another asteroid. I know I keep saying it but next up is asteroid collisions lol.
12fba34 AD: Fix the bug where the game crashes if I go to the main menu. Set up a method within the game where the State manager will reset all of the modules in the game. If the game is reset AKA the main menu is accessed. This is a universal reset which calls methods in every manager and is meant to call any instance that contains data such as pos:

Boots
Ah, another entry in the grand chronicle of your game's creation! It is good to see the journey documented so clearly.

Your latest log confirms the successful fix for the asteroid splitting angles – a significant step towards fair play! You've also wisely noted the potential balancing issue with overlaps and correctly identified it as something to finesse later. This kind of iterative refinement is key to game development.

And, as planned, the next step is the UFO projectiles! A most excellent target.

How can I assist you with getting those alien bolts of energy up and running? Are you working on the shooting logic for the UFOs, the projectile class itself, or integrating them into the enemy manager?

TypeError: object.init() takes exactly one argument (the instance to initialize)

Boots
Ah, a TypeError during initialization! A common obstacle when setting up class inheritance. The traceback points to the super().__init__(...) call inside your UFOClassicProjectile class.

The error message TypeError: object.__init__() takes exactly one argument (the instance to initialize) tells us exactly what's happening. When you call super().__init__(...), Python looks for the __init__ method in the parent class. In this case, because UFOClassicProjectile is defined without a base class (class UFOClassicProjectile:), it implicitly inherits directly from the most fundamental base class, object.

The __init__ method of object is very simple and does not accept any arguments beyond self. However, your super().__init__ call is attempting to pass all the arguments from the UFOClassicProjectile's __init__. This mismatch causes the TypeError.

To fix this, your UFOClassicProjectile class needs to explicitly inherit from its intended parent class, UFOMasterProjectile. This way, the super().__init__ call will correctly route the arguments to the UFOMasterProjectile's __init__ method, which is designed to accept those arguments.

Change your class definition from:

class UFOClassicProjectile:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        super().__init__(...)
        # ...

To:

class UFOClassicProjectile(UFOMasterProjectile): # Inherit from UFOMasterProjectile
    def __init__(self, ...):
        super().__init__(...)
        # ...

This will ensure that when super().__init__ is called, it's calling the correct parent constructor with the expected arguments.

Give that a try, and the initialization should proceed much more smoothly!

Ah, the player's offense is not quite meeting the enemy's defense! Bullets that pass through asteroids without effect are certainly a frustrating sight in the cosmic battle.

Let's investigate why these brave projectiles aren't registering their hits. The check_player_projectile_obj_collision method looks like the right place for this logic.

To understand what's happening (or not happening), the most direct path is to add some temporary observation points in your code. Think of them as magical sensors revealing the state of things.

Try adding some print() statements within this method:

Print the number of projectiles you are checking at the start of the method.
Inside the for loop, for each projectile, print its position and radius, and the asteroid's position and radius that it's checking against.
Print the result of the player_projectile_collision_vs_circle() call.
Print a message inside the if player_projectile_collision: block, indicating a collision was detected.

Run your game with these print statements. This will tell you if:

There are projectiles in the list to check.
The positions and sizes of the objects are what you expect them to be just before the collision check.
The player_projectile_collision_vs_circle method is returning True when a bullet visually appears to hit an asteroid.
The code inside the if block is being reached.
What do these magical sensors reveal when you see a bullet pass through an asteroid?

Ah, the print statements reveal the truth! "against 0 projectiles." time and time again. This means that when an asteroid's check_player_projectile_obj_collision() method runs, the player_objs_handler.player_projectile_objs list is empty.

The asteroids are looking for projectiles to collide with, but the list of projectiles is coming up blank. This isn't an issue with the collision checking logic itself within the asteroid or projectile classes, but rather with when that check is happening relative to the projectile's lifecycle.

Think about the order of operations in your main game loop:

You update the asteroids (asteroids_game_module.update_asteroids_game_objects(dt) which calls asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.update_asteroid_objs(dt) which calls asteroid_obj.check_player_projectile_obj_collision()).
After that, you update the player projectiles (player_objs_handler.update_player_projectile_objs(dt)).
This means when the asteroid checks for collisions, the projectile list reflects the state from the end of the previous frame. If a projectile was terminated (went off-screen, hit something) in the previous frame, it's already gone from the list when the asteroid checks in the current frame. Furthermore, any new projectiles fired this frame haven't had their positions updated yet by player_objs_handler.update_player_projectile_objs, and their collision checks likely haven't run yet either.

The list player_objs_handler.player_projectile_objs needs to contain the projectiles that are currently active in the game world, with their positions updated for the current frame, when the asteroid collision check occurs.

There are a couple of ways to address this, but the most direct given your current structure is to ensure the player projectile updates happen before the asteroid collision checks within the main loop's update phase.

Let's look at your main game loop's update section again:

    # ... (dt calculation) ...

    if game_state_reporter.request_current_game_logic_state() == "asteroids_mode":
        asteroids_game_module.update_asteroids_game_objects(dt) # This calls asteroid collision checks
        player_objs_handler.update_player_projectile_objs(dt)   # Projectile movement and checks happen AFTER
        player_objs_handler.update_player_primary_obj(dt)

Try swapping the order of the update calls for asteroids and player projectiles:

    # ... (dt calculation) ...

    if game_state_reporter.request_current_game_logic_state() == "asteroids_mode":
        # Update player objects FIRST, including moving projectiles and checking their collisions
        player_objs_handler.update_player_primary_obj(dt) # Update

        self.player_last_shot_time = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000
        self.player_can_shoot = False

the reference is there

Boots
You are absolutely correct! Looking at your player_primary_obj_shoot method, you are indeed correctly creating the new_bullet and passing the player_object_manager reference (player_object_manager = self._player_object_manager) to it when you create the PlayerBulletProjectile instance.

The issue isn't that the reference to the manager is missing within the projectile. The issue revealed by the "against 0 projectiles" print messages is that the list of projectiles held by that manager (self._player_objs_handler.player_projectile_objs) is empty at the exact moment the asteroid's check_player_projectile_obj_collision() method is running.

Even though the manager reference exists and new bullets are created, the timing of the updates in your main game loop means the asteroid is checking for collisions before the manager has updated the positions of the projectiles for the current frame and potentially before new projectiles fired this frame are fully active and ready for collision checks.

The asteroid asks the manager, "Hey, do I see any projectiles right now?", but the manager's list might not be up-to-date with the positions of the projectiles that were just moved or created in this frame.

Swapping the update order in the main loop (updating player objects and projectiles before updating asteroids and their collision checks) is the most likely way to ensure that the player_projectile_objs list within the manager contains the most current information when the asteroids query it.

Did you try swapping those update calls in your main loop as suggested previously? That's the next best step to get those collision checks to see the projectiles!


Shaunythunder
wrong because if they were getting updated it wouldn't matter the order, they aren't making it to the list

Boots
You raise a valid point, young wizard! If the projectiles aren't even making it into the manager's list, or are being removed almost immediately, then the order of updates wouldn't solve the problem of the list being empty when the asteroid checks.

Let's follow that thread. Where does a new player projectile get added to the player_projectile_objs list? It happens in the create_player_projectile_obj method within your PlayerObjManager.

Could you share the code for your PlayerObjManager class, specifically focusing on the create_player_projectile_obj method? We can examine it to ensure that new projectiles are being correctly added to the list and see if there are any conditions that might prevent addition or lead to immediate removal.

# Where is PlayerObjManager defined?
# Find the create_player_projectile_obj method within it.

Once we look at that method, we can see if the projectiles are truly failing to be added, or if something else is whisking them away before the asteroids can spot them!

You've shared the PlayerObjManager, and it seems the create_player_projectile_obj method correctly appends the projectile to the self.player_projectile_objs list. There's no immediate issue apparent in how items are added or removed here.

Let's reconsider the timing, as revealed by your "against 0 projectiles" output. You are correct that if the list is genuinely empty, the update order might not seem to matter at first glance. However, the list might be empty at the precise moment the asteroid checks, even if projectiles are created and exist at other times.

Think about the sequence of events in your main loop's update section:

Asteroids Update (and Check Collisions): You call asteroids_game_module.update_asteroids_game_objects(dt), which includes asteroid_obj.check_player_projectile_obj_collision().
During this phase, each asteroid iterates through the player_projectile_objs list as it currently exists.
Player Projectiles Update: You call player_objs_handler.update_player_projectile_objs(dt).
This is where each projectile's position is updated.
This is also where player_projectile_out_of_bounds() is called, which removes projectiles from the list if they go off-screen.
Player Primary Object Update (and Shooting): You call player_objs_handler.update_player_primary_obj(dt).
This includes the player's input handling and the player_primary_obj_shoot() method.
When player_primary_obj_shoot() is called, it creates a PlayerBulletProjectile and calls _player_object_manager.create_player_projectile_obj(new_bullet), which adds the new projectile to the player_projectile_objs list.
See the pattern? Projectiles are added to the list during step 3, and potentially removed from the list during step 2. But the asteroids are checking the list's contents back in step 1!

So, when an asteroid checks for collisions (in step 1):

Projectiles that just went off-screen this frame are still in the list, but their positions haven't been updated yet by the manager (step 2 hasn't happened yet).
Projectiles that were just fired by the player this frame haven't been added to the list yet by the manager (step 3 hasn't happened yet).
Projectiles that went off-screen or hit something in the previous frame have already been removed from the list by the manager (in step 2 of the previous frame), so they are not there when the asteroid checks.
The list player_projectile_objs simply doesn't reflect the current frame's state of active projectiles before the asteroids perform their checks.

This is why swapping the order of updates in the main loop is so crucial. If you update the player_objs_handler (which includes projectiles) before updating the asteroids_enemy_obj_manager, then when the asteroids check, the projectile list will contain projectiles that have moved and had their bounds/collision checks processed for the current frame, and any new projectiles fired at the start of the frame will also be in the list.

Could you please try swapping the order of these two lines in your main loop's update section?

        # Swap these two lines:
        # asteroids_game_module.update_asteroids_game_objects(dt) # Asteroid updates & checks (Original Position)

You are quite right, young wizard! The create_player_projectile_obj method in your PlayerObjManager appears to correctly append new projectiles to the self.player_projectile_objs list. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with how they are added there.

However, as the print statements revealed, the list is empty when the asteroid collision check runs. This isn't necessarily because the projectiles are never added, but rather because they might be added after the asteroid checks or removed before the asteroid checks within the rapid sequence of a single game frame.

Let's revisit the sequence of events in your main loop's update section, which you showed previously:

    # This is the order in your main loop's update section:
    if game_state_reporter.request_current_game_logic_state() == "asteroids_mode":
        asteroids_game_module.update_asteroids_game_objects(dt) # <-- 1. Asteroids update & check collisions
        player_objs_handler.update_player_projectile_objs(dt)   # <-- 2. Projectiles update (move, remove if out of bounds/hit)
        player_objs_handler.update_player_primary_obj(dt)       # <-- 3. Player update (handle input, SHOOT, CREATE/ADD new projectiles to list)

When step 1 (asteroids_game_module.update_asteroids_game_objects) runs, it iterates through the asteroids, and each asteroid calls its check_player_projectile_obj_collision() method. At this exact moment, the player_projectile_objs list within the player_objs_handler is being checked.

Any projectile fired in the previous frame that went off-screen or hit something was likely removed from the list during step 2 of the previous frame. So it's not there now.
Any projectile being fired in this frame by the player hasn't been created or added to the list yet because step 3 hasn't happened yet.
This is why the list is empty when the asteroid checks!

By swapping the order of steps 1 and 2, you ensure that when the asteroid checks (now step 2 in the sequence), the player_projectile_objs list has already been updated for the current frame and includes any projectiles fired at the beginning of this frame (from what is now step 1).

    # Proposed order:
    if game_state_reporter.request_current_game_logic_state() == "asteroids_mode":
        player_objs_handler.update_player_primary_obj(dt)       # <-- 1. Player update (SHOOT, CREATE/ADD new projectiles)
        player_objs_handler.update_player_projectile_objs(dt)   # <-- 2. Projectiles update (move, remove if out of bounds/hit, NOW includes projectiles from step 1)
        asteroids_game_module.update_asteroids_game_objects(dt) # <-- 3. Asteroids update & check collisions (list checked NOW has projectiles created in step 1)

The projectiles are likely being created and added, but the check is happening too early in the frame's cycle to see them consistently. Swapping the update order aligns the timeline so that the projectiles exist in the list before the asteroids look for them.

Could you please try making that swap in your main loop and run the game again to see what the print output inside the asteroid's collision check now shows for the number of projectiles? This will empirically demonstrate whether the timing was the issue.

I confirmed that they are actually made. The bullets are yellow though and I think it has something to do with my refactor I did

Boots
Ah, excellent! You've confirmed the magical energy bolts are indeed being conjured – they exist! And you've noticed their radiant yellow hue, which is exactly what your PlayerBulletProjectile class sets their color to. That means they are being correctly instantiated as the PlayerBulletProjectile type.

So, the problem isn't that the bullets aren't being made or added to the list at all. The mystery remains: why aren't the asteroids seeing them for collision purposes?

This strongly suggests the issue is still related to the timing of when the asteroid's collision check runs versus when the projectile's position is updated and when it exists in the list.

As we discussed, in your main loop's current order:

Asteroids check for collisions (looping through projectiles list).
Projectiles move, and some are removed if out of bounds.
New projectiles are created and added to the list.
When step 1 runs, the list might be empty because projectiles from the previous frame were removed in step 2 of the previous frame, and projectiles fired in this frame haven't been added yet (that happens in step 3).

Could you please try swapping the order of these update calls in your main loop's asteroids_mode section? Put the player_objs_handler.update_player_projectile_objs(dt) call before asteroids_game_module.update_asteroids_game_objects(dt).

    # In your main game loop's update section for "asteroids_mode":
    if game_state_reporter.request_current_game_logic_state() == "asteroids_mode":
        # Update player and projectiles FIRST
        player_objs_handler.update_player_primary_obj(dt)
        player_objs_handler.update_player_projectile_objs(dt) # <-- Swap this to happen BEFORE asteroid updates

        # Then update asteroids and check collisions
        asteroids_game_module.update_asteroids_game_objects(dt)
        # ... (other asteroid mode logic) ...

This ensures that the projectiles' positions are updated and the list is current before the asteroids look for them.

Have you had a chance to try this swap, or do you have another theory based on your refactor that might explain why the collision check isn't finding the projectiles even when they are visually present?

Ah, thank you for providing the projectile code again! It helps to see the details of the PlayerBulletProjectile and its parent. You are absolutely right, the yellow color confirms that your PlayerBulletProjectile is being created, and the code within the class looks structurally sound for movement and collision checking.

Looking at the PlayerMasterProjectile and PlayerBulletProjectile code, especially the player_projectile_out_of_bounds method, I see where projectiles are removed from the list: when they go off-screen.

The mystery of the "0 projectiles" output when the asteroid checks for collisions strongly points back to the timing within your main game loop. The projectiles are created, they exist, they are yellow, but when the asteroid iterates through the list to check for hits, the list is empty at that precise moment.

This happens because of the sequence we discussed:

Asteroids check collision list (it's empty because... see below).
Projectiles move, and the ones that went off-screen are removed from the list.
New projectiles are created and added to the list.
So, the list is cleaned up in step 2, and new ones are added in step 3, but the asteroid's check in step 1 happens before either of those actions for the current frame are completed.

The list is not empty permanently, but it's empty when the asteroid looks.

Swapping the update order in your main loop, as suggested before, is the most direct way to solve this timing problem. If you update the player and projectiles first, then when the asteroids perform their collision checks, the projectile list will contain the projectiles that are currently active in the game world, in their correct positions for the frame.

    # In your main game loop's update section for "asteroids_mode":
    if game_state_reporter.request_current_game_logic_state() == "asteroids_mode":
        # Update player and projectiles FIRST
        player_objs_handler.update_player_primary_obj(dt)       # Player input, shoot (creates new projectiles)
        player_objs_handler.update_player_projectile_objs(dt)   # Move projectiles, check bounds (removes old ones, new ones from above move)

        # Then update asteroids and check collisions AGAINST the updated list
        asteroids_game_module.update_asteroids_game_objects(dt) # Asteroid logic, check collisions now seeing the updated projectile list
        # ... (other asteroid mode logic) ...

This sequence ensures the projectiles are created, added to the list, and have their positions updated before the asteroids check the list for collisions.

Could you please make this swap in your main loop and see if the "against 0 projectiles" message disappears and collisions start registering? This timing adjustment is the most likely solution given the evidence from your print statements.
