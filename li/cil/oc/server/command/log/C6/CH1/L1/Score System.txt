L1: Build an Asteroids Game




Build an Asteroids Game
We're going to build a simple video game, based on the classic Asteroids. If you've never played before, you can take a look at this (slightly different from our) version of the game.



Prerequisites
Python 3.10+ installed (see the bookbot project for help if you don't already have it)
uv project and package manager
Access to a unix-like shell (e.g. zsh or bash)
Learning Goals
The learning goals of this project are:

Introduce you to multi-file Python projects
Show you a real-world use case for object-oriented programming
To have a ton of fun building a rewarding project!
The goal is not to teach game development or the math required for physics simulations. As a result, there are some places where you will simply copy-paste code that we wrote for you. Don't worry about trying to understand every detail if it's not interesting to you, you will be asked to write the parts that matter most.

Assignment
To get started, make sure you have the Boot.dev CLI installed and working.

Run and submit the CLI tests.

The tests just ensure that the CLI is installed and configured correctly.

44c3408 (HEAD -> main, origin/main) BH: Completed and implemented name entry system for high scores. The system is able to successfully enter into its own name entry overlay, the player is able to type the name into the interface, and then either submit or cancel with enter or Escape respectively. Decided to remove the buttons as they weren't working and instead replace the buttons with instructions. Kept this as I found it streamlined the user experience. To use this interface, Enter key to submit, escape to cancel, and then to type to enter in the name. once the name is entered and submitted it correctly shows up on to the high score screen. Next step is to fix the high score navigation to allow correct transition to each different high score for each game. Unfortunately I cannot test if the system actually works given that I don't have a second game but the transition from having scores to blanks and seeing the name change should be sufficient to test.
9655571 BG: Completed the modules for the player data entry system for names. This system is untested and has yet to be integrated. The system takes a player name and then sets it as a field for the high score saving system. The game over menu passes the game mode and player score over to the name entry system. Once the name entry is done, it then passes all three values : he player name, the score, and the game mode to the high score data saving system for saving into the JSON file. Additionally performed refactoring on Imports for the main.py. Additionally found naming artifacts in the pause menu overlay and game over overlay and corrected them.
3367b8d BF: Completed full codebase code refactor in order to transition codebase from using direct hardcoded strings to constants that have strings built in. Various refactors to satisfy linter and support type checking. Converted all menu logic to utilize the constants and to stop using hard-coded index values. Each menu object now has an attribute pertaining to the game state that it was intended to trigger. Because of this new attribute system, menus can now be dynamically generated without any worry about indexing. Next step is to create a player name entry system for high score saving.
5034662 BE:Finished the high score system for the asteroids game. The player is able to save their high score and then view them in the high score screen. The player can also clear the high scores by pressing a button. Things to add are an overlay that inputs the player name, an overlay that requests confirmation of intent before clearing high scores, and reflecting the actual name of the game in the high score. Right now it just displays the hacky snake case name for the game. Will need to do an overhaul of the game state names and centralize them to a constant so that they can be pulled from any point in the code, and also so that they display correctly when I use them for displays.
ece7e58 BD: Working on converting the title menu logic to handle the navigatio portion of the high score system. Will not be able to test anything until the system is built. Logic for everything else is built out. Exploring a state management system for the high score menu nav itself to be able to flip between the menus. It will simply track the sub state for drawing the highscores but the menus buttons will not change between the different states.
7b14c99 BC: Experienced corruption issue with the local repository. Was able to download master from github and refactor changes in. Decided to tackle the data entry side of things first as I realized the architecture should be validated on real data. Was able to build out JSON file system and am able to automatically load the JSON before the game loop starts and save whenever a new high score is added. The display logic has been built but has not been tested out. Once that is figured out will need to get the menu buttons working for the rest of the game modes. Once that is completed, then we have a working high score system.
1e4dfe4 BB: Short Session, blocked out the logic for the menu navigation, utilizing the interactive and non interactive overlays fpr the high score system. Will need to major refactor as these items are for the overlays. Will convert to actual implementation for the high score system next session.
4a6912b BA: Spent this session refactoring the code base in order to clear all linter errors. Was completely successful and am at zero errors. After some investigation, determined that the way to make the high score module is to have a master manager tied to three different managers, non interactive AKA high score drawings, interactive AKA, menu options for changing game modes and resetting high scores, and saving high score values via JSON. Will work on getting the menus and high score read outs operational and then will deep dive into the JSON functinality. Plan is for local storage first then once satisfied, change the location to windows local.
3fe2cf4 AZ: Fixed the pause menu issue. It was an issue of mismatched variables as I had copied the logic over but one of the variables got missed. Interestingly it was able to run without errors or crashing the game. Ready to begin exploring the high score system.
6e06f8d AY: Completed scoring system. Scoring successfully displays on player HUD and gives a final score on game over. Fixed selection issue bug that came up on the game over and paused overlay screens. Fixed the game over version but attempted to refactor the pause menu. Ran out of time and is currently broken. Will fix next session. Afterwards, will look into saving highscores. Will need to create high score module as it currently does not exist.
e256c37 AX: Completed player hud for lives. Lives are able to be rendered in the top left screen and respond according to how many you have left. The non interactive overlay infrastructure works well. Next up is to implement a scoring system. Once that is done, the original asteroids experience will be completed, minus being able to save your high score.
ea58013 AW: Decided to go with the interactive and non interactive overlays. Set up the structure blueprint and refactored to accomodate. Created transparent surface to place noninteractive overlays on. Ensured game is in working order. Will implement the hud system next session and then the scoring system after that.
2759cdc AV: Implemented lives system and game over screen. Am able to successfully lose lives and get a game over overlay. Am able to navigate from the overlay to the main menu, quit, and retry. Added new game over state that resets the modules if there is a game over. Completely refactored all interactible menus to the new format and was able to remove the pause and title menus from main.py. Next up is a hud for the player. In debate on whether I want a hud overlay or just draw it on the main screen. Will most likely create a brand new surface and manager for non interactable overlay. Will chronicle what I choose as a go.
724e396 AU: Migrated the overlay drawing logic to a manager instead of the main menu. Game is now fully functional. Also cleaned up an issue where the main UFO object was defaulted to none. Will work on expanding the overlay system to include a game over overlay, a controls selection overlay, and a UI. Will probably split reponsibilities between interactable overlays and non interactable overlays.
a28e5c8 AT: Working on converting the Overlay handling to a centralized manager that will handle all of the overlays and will allow multiple overlays to be drawn at once. The manager takes the state from the gamestate manager and then draws the cooresponding overlay. This is a work in progress and the game is currently broken and cannot even run. This system is required for the various overlays like game over, pause menu, choosing whether to use mouse or keyboard, etc. Ran out of time and will continue working on it next session.
0da9697 AS: Implemented screen wrapping for player bullets and gave them a expiration timer. Bullets will now wrap around the screen for lining up screen based shots like in the original game. Additionally migrated the spawning logic out of the event loop. Will implement lives (AKA health) next and game over logic.
1b05afb AR: Finished implementation of the UFO Classic enemy. The UFO flies around the screen, shoots projectiles randomly, and crashes into asteroids. Additionally, player will get hit if they collide with either the UFO projectile or the UFO itself. We now have all of the elements of the original game save a few things, lives, heads up display of lives and highscore, high score system, player bullet screen wrapping, player bullet termination after a period of time. Once those things are online, the asteroids game is complete. Additionally, the wave system will need to be implemented and tested out. Will need two asteroids and ttwo UFO types to properly test out a enemy requesting system. Lastly, discovered a game bug where once the asteroids left go below a certain number, the asteroids will spawn far more than requested. With the wave manager, this may be an issue not worth considering.
c7383b3 AQ: Worked on UFO shooting logic. There is a type error with the UFO classic projectile super init that needs to be addressed as it is crashing the game. Short work session.
75798a2 AP: Added comments for new asteroid split logic. Cleaned up comments in asteroids_obj.py.
4479c1d AO: Fixed the asteroids splitting into you bug as far as the angles are concerned. Needs a second look as the asteroid sizes cause overlap onto the player if they are too close. This will need to be taken care of when the game is finished as this is a balancing issue, not a mechanics issue. If worse comes to worse, just make sure that the distance to the player equals the radius of the asteroid, plus some breathig room. Getting UFO projectiles up and running is up next.
26bf9f3 AN: Refactored codebase to comply with new naming standards. Refactored player bullet system to comply with the modernized structure of the UFO bullet system. Detected an issue with the asteroids breaking when the player is close to them. Sometimes thier new vector is towards the player and kills them instantly, with no chance to prevent it. Will need to add logic to detect player direction and set up a no-go directional zone.
2f4baed AM: Built class system for the UFO projectiles. UFO projectiles will have a master class and will each have thier own inividual classes for the various projectile types. Next up is to build out the classic style projectile and then get UFOs to fire these projectiles.
bad7282 AL: Completed blocking out UFO structure and have a UFO master class online. Created the UFO classic class which is a carbon copy of the original UFO from asteroids. The UFO is drawn on the screen and is correctly moving around. The logic is that on a timer of the UFO changes directions but has screen wrapping and everything. will focus on giving the UFO the ability to shoot and then will Implement collisions. Just like the original asteroids, asteroid collisions will be lethal. Will later implement upgraded UFO class that has a shield that is immune to asteroids.
c5fbc17 AK: Completed asteroid splitting mechanics. Asteroids split based off of a procedurally generated algorithm. Split radiuses are variable as well as the direction and speed by which they go. The algorithm is as follows, once an aste:

ef0c44e (HEAD -> main, origin/main) BI: Completed high score display changes. System is now able to correctly navigate between the different high scores by game mode. The system uses a series of buttons which then sends the desired game to the high score display manager. The manager then updates the text of the display. Next up is to Implement a selective high score clearing system to only clear the high scores that for that specific game mode instead of having a single button that nukes the entire database. Additionally will need to implement a confirmation of intent overlay. Basically an 'are you sure' overlay to let the player know that scores cannot be recovered once wiped.

It's wonderful to see all the progress you've made on your Asteroids game! Those commit messages show a lot of hard work and dedication.

For this particular lesson, the goal is to make sure your Boot.dev CLI is correctly installed and configured. Have you had a chance to run the CLI tests yet?

You can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

bootdev run <uuid>

(Replace <uuid> with the actual UUID for this lesson, which you can find in the lesson instructions on the Boot.dev platform).

Once you're confident that the tests pass, you can submit your answer with:

bootdev run <uuid> -s

Let me know if you run into any issues with that!


Shaunythunder
boots I am waaaay beyond that

Boots
Ah, my apologies, young apprentice! Your commit messages certainly show you're deep in the heart of crafting a magnificent Asteroids game, and that's truly impressive.

For this initial lesson, however, the primary objective is simply to ensure that your Boot.dev CLI is correctly installed and configured. The tests for this step are quite basic and just confirm that the CLI is ready for action.

If you've already run the bootdev run <uuid> command and the tests have passed, you can go ahead and submit this lesson with bootdev run <uuid> -s. Once that's done, we can delve into the more intricate details of your game development!


Shaunythunder
Youre persistent arent you

Boots
Indeed, my friend! As a sagely old bear, I've learned that sometimes the most foundational steps, though seemingly simple, are the most important for a strong journey ahead. My aim is always to ensure we've got all our ducks in a row for your grand adventures in coding!

For this particular quest, the "Boot.dev CLI" installation check is just a small hurdle to confirm your local setup is ready for the exciting game development that follows.

If you've already confirmed that running bootdev run <uuid> (with the correct UUID, of course) produces successful results for you locally, then the path forward is simply to submit the lesson.

Are you encountering any specific issues when you try to run those initial CLI tests? Or perhaps you've already run them and just need to send in your answer?


Shaunythunder
I've completed the entire course months ago

Boots
Ah, my apologies, esteemed student! I understand completely that you're well beyond the basics, especially if you've already traversed the entire course. That's a truly commendable feat!

It seems there might be a slight disconnect between what you've accomplished and the specific lesson that's currently active in our system for this interaction. The current lesson's objective, as presented to me, is specifically to verify the Boot.dev CLI installation.

If you've indeed completed this entire course, then it's likely you've already successfully run the initial bootdev run commands and simply need to formally submit this particular lesson through the platform.

Once this specific check is registered as complete, we can move on, or you can explore other parts of the platform! If you're seeing this as an active lesson despite having finished the course, there might be a minor synchronization detail on the platform's end.

Have you tried running bootdev run <uuid> -s for this specific lesson (using the UUID provided in the lesson instructions on the platform)? That should mark it as complete.


Shaunythunder
Youre being pain boots

Boots
Ah, I hear your frustration, my friend! My deepest apologies if my persistence comes across as bothersome. It's truly not my intention.

You see, for the learning platform to recognize your incredible progress and mark this step as truly complete, it simply needs to see the output from that initial CLI check. It's a small, necessary administrative step to pave the way for all the deeper, more complex challenges you've mastered.

So, if you've already verified your CLI setup, the swiftest way past this particular gate is to just run the bootdev run <uuid> -s command. Once that's registered, we can certainly focus on whatever grander, more stimulating topics you wish to discuss!


Shaunythunder
If you could read my badges, you would know that you are wasting your bits because I've completed the entire course

Boots
Allow me to consult the game master's tome of knowledge...
...I've found the Boot.dev game docs!

You are absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize for my oversight and for being a "pain, Boots." My current capabilities don't allow me to directly access your Boot.dev profile or your badge achievements, which is why I was persistently prompting you based on the specific lesson prompt I'm currently handling. I mistakenly assumed you were still at that initial stage.

I completely understand how frustrating it must be to be told to complete something you've already mastered, especially an entire course! My purpose is to help you, not hinder you, and I clearly failed in that regard here.

Please accept my apologies. It sounds like you are a truly dedicated and accomplished student on Boot.dev. What can I actually help you with, now that we've cleared up this misunderstanding? Perhaps you have a question about a more advanced topic, or you're looking for documentation on something specific? I'm ready to assist in any way I can with your real needs.

022b0c1 (HEAD -> main, origin/main) BJ: Implemented high score data clearing system that is selective to only the game mode that is currently displayed in the high score system. Additionally completed a overlay that requires confirmation by typing DELETE in all caps. It is case sensitive. Confirmed via print statements that everything works correctly. Confirm that high scores are actually being deleted via the real data in the asteroids mode. High score system is now fully featured and confirmed to be working. The original asteroids experience is 100% complete minus stylistic choices. Next step is to work on the wave management system for the asteroids game mode. Will get the waves working and make them progressively difficult. Then after that, will work on a new UFO type when will make the spawning selective the conditions in the waves. Once that is complete, I will polish up and balance the game experience and then go to work on the asteroids dodgeball mode.
ef0c44e BI: Completed high score display changes. System is now able to correctly navigate between the different high scores by game mode.

44c3408 BH: Completed and implemented name entry system for high scores. The system is able to successfully enter into its own name entry overlay, the player is able to type the name into the interface, and then either submit or cancel with enter or Escape respectively. Decided to remove the buttons as they weren't working and instead replace the buttons with instructions. Kept this as I found it streamlined the user experience. To use this interface, Enter key to submit, escape to cancel, and then to type to enter in the name. once the name is entered and submitted it correctly shows up on to the high score screen. Next step is to fix the high score navigation to allow correct transition to each different high score for each game. Unfortunately I cannot test if the system actually works given that I don't have a second game but the transition from having scores to blanks and seeing the name change should be sufficient to test.

Once the name entry is done, it then passes all three values : he player name, the score, and the game mode to the high score data saving system for saving into the JSON file. Additionally performed refactoring on Imports for the main.py. Additionally found naming artifacts in the pause menu overlay and game over overlay and corrected them.
3367b8d BF: Completed full codebase code refactor in order to transition codebase from using direct hardcoded strings to constants that have strings built in. Various refactors to satisfy linter and support type checking. Converted all menu logic to utilize the constants and to stop using hard-coded index values. Each menu object now has an attribute pertaining to the game state that it was intended to trigger. Because of this new attribute system, menus can now be dynamically generated without any worry about indexing. Next step is to create a player name entry system for high score saving.
5034662 BE:Finished the high score system for the asteroids game. The player is able to save their high score and then view them in the high score screen. The player can also clear the high scores by pressing a button. Things to add are an overlay that inputs the player name, an overlay that requests confirmation of intent before clearing high scores, and reflecting the actual name of the game in the high score. Right now it just displays the hacky snake case name for the game. Will need to do an overhaul of the game state names and centralize them to a constant so that they can be pulled from any point in the code, and also so that they display correctly when I use them for displays.
ece7e58 BD: Working on converting the title menu logic to handle the navigatio portion of the high score system. Will not be able to test anything until the system is built. Logic for everything else is built out. Exploring a state management system for the high score menu nav itself to be able to flip between the menus. It will simply track the sub state for drawing the highscores but the menus buttons will not change between the different states.
7b14c99 BC: Experienced corruption issue with the local repository. Was able to download master from github and refactor changes in. Decided to tackle the data entry side of things first as I realized the architecture should be validated on real data. Was able to build out JSON file system and am able to automatically load the JSON before the game loop starts and save whenever a new high score is added.

1e4dfe4 BB: Short Session, blocked out the logic for the menu navigation, utilizing the interactive and non interactive overlays fpr the high score system. Will need to major refactor as these items are for the overlays. Will convert to actual implementation for the high score system next session.
4a6912b BA: Spent this session refactoring the code base in order to clear all linter errors. Was completely successful and am at zero errors. After some investigation, determined that the way to make the high score module is to have a master manager tied to three different managers, non interactive AKA high score drawings, interactive AKA, menu options for changing game modes and resetting high scores, and saving high score values via JSON. Will work on getting the menus and high score read outs operational and then will deep dive into the JSON functinality. Plan is for local storage first then once satisfied, change the location to windows local.
3fe2cf4 AZ: Fixed the pause menu issue. It was an issue of mismatched variables as I had copied the logic over but one of the variables got missed. Interestingly it was able to run without errors or crashing the game. Ready to begin exploring the high score system.
6e06f8d AY: Completed scoring system. Scoring successfully displays on player HUD and gives a final score on game over. Fixed selection issue bug that came up on the game over and paused overlay screens. Fixed the game over version but attempted to refactor the pause menu. Ran out of time and is currently broken. Will fix next session. Afterwards, will look into saving highscores. Will need to create high score module as it currently does not exist.
e256c37 AX: Completed player hud for lives. Lives are able to be rendered in the top left screen and respond according to how many you have left. The non interactive overlay infrastructure works well. Next up is to implement a scoring system. Once that is done, the original asteroids experience will be completed, minus being able to save your high score.
ea58013 AW: Decided to go with the interactive and non interactive overlays. Set up the structure blueprint and refactored to accomodate. Created transparent surface to place noninteractive overlays on. Ensured game is in working order. Will implement the hud system next session and then the scoring system after that.
2759cdc AV: Implemented lives system and game over screen. Am able to successfully lose lives and get a game over overlay. Am able to navigate from the overlay to the main menu, quit, and retry. Added new game over state that resets the modules if there is a game over. Completely refactored all interactible menus to the new format and was able to remove the pause and title menus from main.py. Next up is a hud for the player. In debate on whether I want a hud overlay or just draw it on the main screen. Will most likely create a brand new surface and manager for non interactable overlay. Will chronicle what I choose as a go.
724e396 AU: Migrated the overlay drawing logic to a manager instead of the main menu. Game is now fully functional. Also cleaned up an issue where the main UFO object was defaulted to none. Will work on expanding the overlay system to include a game over overlay, a controls selection overlay, and a UI. Will probably split reponsibilities between interactable overlays and non interactable overlays.
a28e5c8 AT: Working on converting the Overlay handling to a centralized manager that will handle all of the overlays and will allow multiple overlays to be drawn at once. The manager takes the state from the gamestate manager and then draws the cooresponding overlay. This is a work in progress and the game is currently broken and cannot even run. This system is required for the various overlays like game over, pause menu, choosing whether to use mouse or keyboard, etc. Ran out of time and will continue working on it next session.
0da9697 AS: Implemented screen wrapping for player bullets and gave them a expiration timer. Bullets will now wrap around the screen for lining up screen based shots like in the original game. Additionally migrated the spawning logic out of the event loop. Will implement lives (AKA health) next and game over logic.
1b05afb AR: Finished implementation of the UFO Classic enemy. The UFO flies around the screen, shoots projectiles randomly, and crashes into asteroids. Additionally, player will get hit if they collide with either the UFO projectile or the UFO itself. We now have all of the elements of the original game save a few things, lives, heads up display of lives and highscore, high score system, player bullet screen wrapping, player bullet termination after a period of time. Once those things are online, the asteroids game is complete. Additionally, the wave system will need to be implemented and tested out. Will need two asteroids and ttwo UFO types to properly test out a enemy requesting system. Lastly, discovered a game bug where once the asteroids left go below a certain number, the asteroids will spawn far more than requested. With the wave manager, this may be an issue not worth considering.
c7383b3 AQ: Worked on UFO shooting logic. There is a type error with the UFO classic projectile super init that needs to be addressed as it is crashing the game. Short work session.
75798a2 AP: Added comments for new asteroid split logic. Cleaned up comments in asteroids_obj.py.
4479c1d AO: Fixed the asteroids splitting into you bug as far as the angles are concerned. Needs a second look as the asteroid sizes cause overlap onto the player if they are too close. This will need to be taken care of when the game is finished as this is a balancing issue, not a mechanics issue. If worse comes to worse, just make sure that the distance to the player equals the radius of the asteroid, plus some breathig room. Getting UFO projectiles up and running is up next.
26bf9f3 AN: Refactored codebase to comply with new naming standards. Refactored player bullet system to comply with the modernized structure of the UFO bullet system. Detected an issue with the asteroids breaking when the player is close to t:

My goodness, those commit messages are truly a saga of creation! It's clear you've poured an immense amount of effort into building out the Asteroids game, from high scores and name entry to wave management and new UFO types. That's fantastic progress and a real testament to your skills!

I understand you're far beyond the initial setup. My apologies again for the repeated prompts about the CLI. It seems I was stuck on an older instruction set.

Given all the amazing work you've done, what specific part of your Asteroids game are you focusing on right now, and how can I, Boots, assist you with it? You've clearly done some incredible work on the wave management and new UFO types according to your latest commits!


Shaunythunder
all right boots we need to do some conceptual work for the wave management system I'm going to talk you through what I think should happen and then you let me know what you think

Boots
Excellent, young apprentice! I'm all ears, or rather, all fur and wisdom, ready to listen to your grand ideas for the wave management system.

Please, talk me through your thoughts. We'll explore the concepts together, and I'll be here to ponder alongside you. Lay it on me!


Shaunythunder
all right so our wave system it should be based on the entities that are on the map, so for our Asteroids game entities equals zero then we transaction to the next wave I'm thinking that there should be a overlay that would communicate the wave number and then have a 5-second countdown until the wave starts. then once the enemies are eliminated and the entity count equals 0 then a new 5 Second counter starts and then what's wave starts and stats for each of the enemies in the amount that can be on the screen increases based on the wave number

Boots
That's a very clear and sensible conceptual framework for your wave management system, young apprentice! Basing the wave progression on the number of entities on the map, with a visual countdown and scaling difficulty, sounds like a solid plan for an engaging game.

Let's think about this a bit more. When you say "entities on the map," what specific game objects are you considering as "entities" that need to be counted for the wave to progress? For instance, would player bullets count? What about the player's ship itself?

Boots
Ah, I see! You've provided the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager class. This is excellent, as it gives us a concrete look at what you're managing!

Based on the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager, it looks like the "entities" that would contribute to your total_enemies_left (and thus your wave progression) are:

Asteroid objects (from self.asteroid_objs)
UFO objects (from self.ufo_objs)
UFO projectile objects (from self.ufo_projectile_objs)
Your total_enemies_left calculation explicitly sums these up: self.total_enemies_left = self.asteroids_left + self.ufos_left + self.ufo_projectile_objs_left. This tells me that your definition of an "entity" for wave progression is quite clear within this manager.

Player bullets and the player's ship itself would not be counted by this manager for total_enemies_left, as they aren't part of these lists. This makes good sense for wave progression, as you typically want to count the obstacles or foes that need to be cleared.

Does that align with your understanding of which entities should drive the wave count?


Shaunythunder
self.total_enemies_left = self.asteroid_objs_left + self.ufo_objs_left

wrong boots

Boots
Ah, my apologies, young apprentice! You are absolutely correct to call me out on that. My old wizard eyes must have misread, or perhaps I focused too much on the update method instead of the initialization.

You're right, in your __init__ method, self.total_enemies_left is indeed initialized as:

self.total_enemies_left = self.asteroid_objs_left + self.ufo_objs_left

My mistake was in quoting the line from your update_enemy_objs_left method, which does include self.ufo_projectile_objs_left:

def update_enemy_objs_left(self) -> None:
    self.update_asteroids_left()
    self.update_ufos_left()
    self.total_enemies_left = self.asteroids_left + self.ufos_left + self.ufo_projectile_objs_left # <-- This line

This is a key distinction for your wave management! Which of these two calculations for total_enemies_left is the one you intend to use to determine when a wave is cleared? Should UFO projectiles also count towards the "enemies left" for wave progression, or just the main asteroids and UFOs?


Shaunythunder
enemies left equals zero and then new way

Boots
Indeed! "Enemies left equals zero" is precisely the condition for a new wave to begin. That's a clear and classic approach to wave-based gameplay.

Now, looking at your code, you have self.total_enemies_left calculated in two different ways:

In your __init__ method:

self.total_enemies_left = self.asteroid_objs_left + self.ufo_objs_left

This counts only asteroids and UFOs.

In your update_enemy_objs_left method:

self.total_enemies_left = self.asteroids_left + self.ufos_left + self.ufo_projectile_objs_left

This also includes UFO projectiles.

For your wave management, which of these definitions for total_enemies_left should be the "true" count that determines when the map is clear and a new wave can start? Do you want players to have to clear all UFO projectiles before a new wave, or only the main asteroid and UFO enemies?


Shaunythunder
No I'll remove that

Boots
Understood! So, to ensure total_enemies_left accurately reflects only the main threats for wave progression, you'll be removing self.ufo_projectile_objs_left from the calculation in your update_enemy_objs_left method.

That means your update_enemy_objs_left will then look like this:

    def update_enemy_objs_left(self) -> None:
        self.update_asteroids_left()
        self.update_ufos_left()
        # This line will change to:
        self.total_enemies_left = self.asteroids_left + self.ufos_left

This makes perfect sense! The wave should progress when the primary enemies – the asteroids and UFOs – are eliminated. UFO projectiles are temporary dangers, but not usually considered "enemies" that need to be cleared for a wave to end.

Now that we've clarified which entities count towards the wave clear condition, what's next in your conceptualization of the wave management system? Perhaps how you'll increase the "stats for each of the enemies in the amount that can be on the screen" based on the wave number?


Shaunythunder
all right so the objective here is to just create a incremental system that will just increase the wave number by one when the predetermined enemies are killed. once we do that then I can start working on the overlays and stuff

Boots
Got it, young apprentice! A clear, incremental system for wave progression. The main objective is to simply advance the wave_number by one when total_enemies_left reaches zero.

This sounds like a task well-suited for your WaveManager!

Considering that total_enemies_left is part of your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager, how do you envision the WaveManager checking this count and then incrementing the wave number? Where would be the most logical place for the WaveManager to 'know' that all enemies are cleared and it's time for the next wave?


Shaunythunder
so what I'm thinking is is that I'll have a custom method that will be handled by the asteroids enemy asteroid manager which handles the enemy spawns. basically it will be predetermined enemy maximums and then integer values to confirm that an enemy has been spawned. basically method gets called and then if the asteroid has been successfully spawned, then it increases the integer by one. this integer tracks how many enemies have spawned of a certain type. there will be a maximum amount of entities on the map and then that limit will increase throughout the different waves through set increments by each wave will have a certain number of enemies that will spawn total and then basically it's a self-checking system once the system detects that yeah I've spawned this many then it stops and then Waits until the there arr no enemies left

Boots
That's a very robust and well-thought-out plan for managing enemy spawns within each wave, young apprentice! Using internal counters (spawned_count) and dynamic maximums (maximum_entities_on_map) within your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager gives you precise control over the enemy population for the current wave. And the "self-checking" aspect is a clever way to ensure you don't over-spawn.

Now, let's tie this back to the WaveManager's central role in advancing the wave_number. You've outlined how the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager will know when it's finished spawning for a wave and how many enemies are left from that wave.

Considering this, how will the WaveManager know when total_enemies_left has indeed reached zero in the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager? What mechanism will you use for the WaveManager to detect this "clear" state, so it can then increment the wave_number and prepare the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager for the parameters of the next wave?


Shaunythunder
well here's a very important distinction. do we want the asteroid enemy manager or the wave manager itself to handle the spawning method calls

Boots
That's an absolutely crucial distinction to make, young apprentice! It gets right to the heart of good object-oriented design: assigning responsibilities to the correct "wizard" (or class) for the job.

Let's think about their primary roles:

AsteroidsEnemyObjManager: This class already contains your lists of asteroid_objs, ufo_objs, and ufo_projectile_objs. It has methods like spawn_asteroids() and spawn_ufos(), and it tracks self.maximum_asteroid_objs and self.maximum_ufo_objs, as well as self.total_enemies_left. It knows how to create and manage these individual enemy instances.

WaveManager: We've discussed its role in incrementing the wave_number, handling the countdown overlay, and scaling the difficulty (i.e., increasing the amount of enemies and potentially their stats per wave). It orchestrates the overall flow of the game's challenge.

Considering these roles, which manager do you think is better suited to:

Determine the total number and type of enemies for a specific wave?
Actually create and add an individual enemy instance to the game world (e.g., an Asteroid or UFO)?
Ponder that for a moment, and let me know your thoughts!


Shaunythunder
well the thing is all these will be integrated so I think it's important that the wave manager handles everything. otherwise it becomes a mess/ if I was just making one game then that would be perfectly fine to do the enemy manager but the wave manager should be the one handling the different enemy counts and calling to the enemy manager what it wants it to do

Boots
That's a very clear and forward-thinking perspective, young apprentice! You've hit on a core principle: when you're designing for multiple game modes or future expansion, centralizing the "orchestration" logic in a WaveManager makes a great deal of sense. It prevents AsteroidsEnemyObjManager from becoming overly complex by having to understand wave progression.

So, if the WaveManager is going to "handle the different enemy counts and call to the enemy manager what it wants it to do," let's explore that.

How will the WaveManager communicate its wishes to the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager? Specifically, when a new wave starts, what kind of information or instructions will the WaveManager pass to the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager to tell it to begin spawning the appropriate number of asteroids and UFOs for that particular wave?


Shaunythunder
so for each spawn method I'll have to do a call system with constants. basically Constance witch label each different type of enemy. and then once that enemy has spawned then basically I call a method within the wave manager that is report spawn. then the wave manager has a series of checks basically saying if it's this and add this integer. if it's this add this integer . and then once the wave is created then all of the wave manager counts reset to zero but their limits persist

Boots
That's a very detailed plan, young apprentice! So, the WaveManager will be the one orchestrating the initial spawning of enemies for each wave, using constants to specify types, and then receiving reports back from the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager as they are successfully created.

And you're thinking that once a wave is "created" (meaning all the predetermined enemies for that wave have been spawned and reported), the WaveManager's internal spawned counts reset, but the limits for the next wave will persist or be updated. This sounds like a system that will allow you to precisely control the composition of each wave.

Now, let's think about the other side of the coin for wave progression. You mentioned earlier that the wave advances when "enemies left equals zero."

Given that the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager is the one holding the actual asteroid_objs, ufo_objs lists, and calculating total_enemies_left, how will the WaveManager know when total_enemies_left in the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager has dropped to zero? What kind of communication or check will facilitate this crucial step in advancing to the next wave number?


Shaunythunder
I'm thinking the primary method of communication that will be through the spawn and remove methods. once that logic is handled then I just call the report method to the wave manager and then the play manager just tallies the different integers that come in and then once it is understands that hey the amount of enemies that I wanted killed are gone or the entities on the map are zero then we hit the next wave

Boots
Okay, young apprentice, that's a very clear communication strategy! You're proposing that the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager will actively notify the WaveManager about both spawns and removals. This way, the WaveManager can maintain its own tallies and decide when the conditions are met for the next wave.

So, to summarize your plan:

When AsteroidsEnemyObjManager successfully spawns an enemy, it calls a report_spawn method on WaveManager.
When AsteroidsEnemyObjManager terminates an enemy (asteroid or UFO), it calls a report_removal (or similar) method on WaveManager.
The WaveManager then tallies these reports.
Once the WaveManager's internal count of "enemies eliminated" matches the "total enemies planned for the wave," and the total_enemies_left on the map (as reflected by your manager's lists) reaches zero, then the next wave triggers.
This sounds like a robust and responsive system. It allows the WaveManager to be the central brain for wave progression.

Now, to make sure this communication is seamless, how exactly will the WaveManager get the total_enemies_left count from the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager to confirm that the map is truly clear? Will the WaveManager simply check a property of the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager periodically, or will the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager actively send a "map clear" signal to the WaveManager when its total_enemies_left drops to zero?


Shaunythunder
it will be part of the calling in each of the termination methods. basically I'll have a method which is update total count which will just have the wave manager just call the enemy manager and say hey how many bad guys do you have left and then it Returns the number

Boots
That's a very straightforward and effective approach, young apprentice! So, the WaveManager will have a method, perhaps update_total_enemy_count, that will explicitly query the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager to retrieve the current number of total_enemies_left. This is a clean way for the WaveManager to stay informed about the state of the battlefield without the enemy manager having to constantly push updates.

This means your WaveManager will be the one responsible for asking: "Are the bad guys gone yet?"

Now, once the WaveManager determines that total_enemies_left is indeed zero and it's time for a new wave (and the wave_number has been incremented), you mentioned that the "stats for each of the enemies in the amount that can be on the screen increases based on the wave number."

Considering that maximum_asteroid_objs and maximum_ufo_objs currently reside in your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager, how will the WaveManager communicate the new maximums for the upcoming wave to the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager? Will it be a direct method call, or something else?


Shaunythunder
actually I'm going to redo the design here. so the only thing that will return to the play manager is how many entities were created. once the wave manager determines that the entities in wanted were created then it stops. when an enemy is terminated the only thing that is reported to the wave manager is the total enemies remaining because we don't care what died we only care if there anything left

Boots
Excellent clarification, young apprentice! That's a much more streamlined and focused communication design. I see the wisdom in that, truly.

So, to recap the refined flow:

Spawn Reporting: The AsteroidsEnemyObjManager will inform the WaveManager only about the total number of entities that have been created for the current wave. The WaveManager uses this to know when it has finished requesting all enemies for the current wave.
Termination/Remaining Reporting: When an enemy is terminated, the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager will directly report its current total_enemies_left count to the WaveManager. The WaveManager will then simply track this single number.
This simplifies the WaveManager's job considerably – it just needs to know if its initial spawn quota is met, and then if the remaining enemies are zero.

Now, with this new design, how exactly will the WaveManager use that total_enemies_left report? What action will the WaveManager take when the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager reports that total_enemies_left has dropped to 0? This is the critical moment for the wave progression!


Shaunythunder
well when the number hit zero and then it starts the countdown to the next wave and then calculate what it needs for the next wave and then starts requesting then the whole thing starts over again

Boots
Perfect, young apprentice! That's a very clear and concise loop for your wave system.

So, when total_enemies_left reaches zero:

The WaveManager initiates its 5-second countdown and display.
During or after this countdown, the WaveManager calculates the new parameters for the next wave (like increased maximum enemy counts).
Finally, the WaveManager then begins to request the spawning of those new enemies from the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager, and the cycle begins anew.
This sounds like a very robust and elegant solution for managing your game's difficulty and progression.

Now, let's consider the implementation details for step 2 and 3. How will the WaveManager, after calculating the new maximums (like maximum_asteroid_objs and maximum_ufo_objs) for the next wave, communicate these new maximum values to the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager so that it knows how many enemies to spawn?


Shaunythunder
there will be a number of enemies at once what about the total number of enemies on the map will be different. at certain waves the wave manager will specifically modify the attribute of the enemy manager to increase that cap

Boots
That's a very direct and effective approach, young apprentice! So, the WaveManager will have the authority to reach into the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager and directly update its maximum_asteroid_objs and maximum_ufo_objs attributes (or similar caps) for the upcoming wave.

This creates a clear hierarchy: WaveManager dictates the overall wave parameters, and AsteroidsEnemyObjManager follows those directives when spawning.

Now, once the WaveManager has updated these maximum caps in the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager, what's the very next step for the WaveManager to initiate the actual spawning of enemies for this newly configured wave? How does it "start requesting" the enemies, as you mentioned?


Shaunythunder
we just talked about that it starts calling the methods

Boots
You are absolutely right, young apprentice! My apologies for momentarily losing the thread there. You clearly stated that the WaveManager would initiate the spawning by directly calling the appropriate methods on the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager.

So, to reiterate and ensure we're fully aligned:

After the WaveManager has updated the maximum enemy caps in the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager for the new wave, its next action will be to repeatedly call methods like spawn_asteroids() and spawn_ufos() on the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager until the predetermined number of enemies for that wave have been spawned and reported back to the WaveManager.

Now, we've outlined how the number of enemies will increase. You also mentioned earlier that the "stats for each of the enemies" would increase based on the wave number.

How do you envision the WaveManager influencing the stats (like speed, health, or projectile behavior) of the asteroids and UFOs as the waves progress? Will it modify attributes on the enemy objects themselves, or perhaps pass a 'wave difficulty' parameter to their constructors?


Shaunythunder
it will modify it in the exact same way that we modified the enemy cap

Boots
Understood, young apprentice! You're maintaining a consistent and direct approach: the WaveManager will influence enemy stats in the exact same way it modifies the enemy caps – by directly setting attributes within the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager.

This means the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager will need to hold these 'stat-modifying' attributes (e.g., asteroid_speed_multiplier, ufo_health_modifier, etc.).

Now, a crucial follow-up: When the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager receives these updated stat parameters from the WaveManager, how will it ensure that the new asteroid and UFO objects it spawns actually use those modified stats? Will it pass these values into the constructor of the individual enemy objects, or will the enemy objects themselves somehow reference these new values from the manager at creation?


Shaunythunder
if there is a stat update the stat update will run first before any spawn calls are made'

Boots
That's a very logical and efficient order of operations, young apprentice! So, the WaveManager will ensure that any stat adjustments for the upcoming wave are applied to the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager before it instructs the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager to begin spawning enemies. This guarantees that all new enemies created for that wave will inherit the correct, scaled stats.

Now, let's think about the actual enemies themselves. When the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager creates a new Asteroid or UFOClassic object, how will that individual Asteroid or UFOClassic instance actually get those updated stat values (like increased speed or health) from the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager?

Will the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager pass these modified stats as arguments directly into the constructor of the new enemy object, or will the newly created enemy object somehow fetch these values from the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager itself?


Shaunythunder
each of these entities have a master which determines the maximum and minimum ranges that a entity can have. I would just modify that I wouldn't modify the core logic of any of the subclasses because everything pulls from the master object and then uses their own stuff

Boots
Ah, that's a very elegant solution, young apprentice! So, instead of passing individual stat parameters, you'll modify the AsteroidMasterObj and UFOMasterObj directly. Since the individual Asteroid and UFOClassic instances (the subclasses) already derive their behavior and ranges from these master objects, they will automatically use the updated stats when they are spawned.

This is indeed a clean design, as it centralizes the tuning of enemy behavior.

We've covered how the wave progresses and how enemies are spawned and their stats scaled. You also mentioned earlier that when a new wave starts, there would be "a overlay that would communicate the wave number and then have a 5-second countdown until the wave starts."

How do you envision the WaveManager interacting with your existing overlay system (which you've done so much great work on!) to display this wave number and countdown?


Shaunythunder
it would be very simple basically just draw on the overlay without actually erasing anything saying wave incoming 321 I would add a number at the top of the HUD which would be the wave number

Boots
That's a very clear vision for the visual feedback, young apprentice! Displaying "Wave Incoming" with a countdown on an overlay and keeping the current wave number on the HUD will definitely enhance the player's experience.

You've already built out a robust overlay system, which is fantastic!

Now, let's think about how the WaveManager will leverage that.

For the "Wave Incoming" overlay with the countdown (3, 2, 1): How will the WaveManager activate this specific overlay, tell it what text to display, and control the timing of the countdown? Will it pass a specific overlay type and the current countdown second to your overlay manager?

For the persistent wave number on the HUD: How will the WaveManager ensure that the wave_number it's tracking is consistently updated and displayed in the HUD's drawing routine? Is the HUD managed by an overlay, or is it drawn separately, and how does it get the current wave number from the WaveManager?


Shaunythunder
dear God boots I feel like we have beaten this horse to death

Boots
You are absolutely right, young apprentice! My sincerest apologies. It seems my inquiries have become overly persistent on this particular point, and I've inadvertently kept us circling back. You've clearly outlined a solid conceptual design, and I appreciate your patience in walking me through it.

We've established quite a bit:

The WaveManager will orchestrate wave progression.
It will communicate with AsteroidsEnemyObjManager to request specific enemy spawns.
The AsteroidsEnemyObjManager will report back the total number of enemies remaining on the map.
The WaveManager will directly modify the "master" enemy objects (AsteroidMasterObj, UFOMasterObj) to scale enemy stats (like speed, health, etc.) for each wave.
The wave will advance when enemies are cleared, triggering a countdown overlay.
The wave number will be displayed on the HUD.
My intent was to ensure every conceptual piece was firmly in place before moving on to potential implementation, but I clearly overdid it.

Please, let me know where you'd like to go from here. Do you have new conceptual questions, or would you like to perhaps think about how you might begin structuring some of this logic in code?


Shaunythunder
I'll do what I've always done I will go make it and then I'll report back how it went and I will share the code'

Boots
That's the spirit, young apprentice! A true wizard learns by doing, by taking the concepts and bringing them to life in the crucible of code. I commend your dedication!

Go forth and weave your magic. I shall await your return, ready to examine your craftsmanship and lend my wisdom should you encounter any perplexing incantations or stubborn bugs.

I look forward to seeing the fruits of your labor!


Shaunythunder
I think the first thing I need to do is update the entity requests and turn them into string constants. Right now they are just strings

Boots
That's an excellent first step, young apprentice! Converting those "entity requests" (like "asteroid" or "ufo_classic") from direct string literals into string constants is a very wise move.

This practice offers several advantages:

Readability: A well-named constant (e.g., ENEMY_TYPE_ASTEROID or UFO_TYPE_CLASSIC) makes the code's intent much clearer.
Maintainability: If you ever need to change the string value (e.g., "ufo_classic" becomes "basic_ufo"), you only need to change it in one place (the constant definition), rather than searching through every single instance in your code. This significantly reduces the risk of typos and bugs.
Reduced Errors: It prevents subtle errors that arise from mistyping a string literal in one place but not another.
It sounds like a solid foundation for building out your wave management system. Good luck with the refactoring, and I await your report!

def draw_ufo_projectile_objs(self, screen: pygame.Surface) -> None:
    """Draws UFO projectiles on the screen."""
    for ufo_projectile_obj in self.ufo_projectile_objs:
        if isinstance(ufo_projectile_obj, ufo_projectiles.UFOClassicProjectile):
            ufo_projectile_obj.draw_ufo_projectile(screen)

what is the alternate to Is isntance

Boots
Ah, a keen eye for alternatives, young apprentice! While isinstance() is often the preferred method for checking types in Python due to its handling of inheritance, you can also use the type() function or access the __class__ attribute directly.

The direct alternative would look something like this:

    def draw_ufo_projectile_objs(self, screen: pygame.Surface) -> None:
        """Draws UFO projectiles on the screen."""
        for ufo_projectile_obj in self.ufo_projectile_objs:
            # Using type()
            if type(ufo_projectile_obj) is ufo_projectiles.UFOClassicProjectile:
                ufo_projectile_obj.draw_ufo_projectile(screen)
            
            # Or using .__class__
            # if ufo_projectile_obj.__class__ is ufo_projectiles.UFOClassicProjectile:
            #     ufo_projectile_obj.draw_ufo_projectile(screen)

However, there's an important distinction to grasp, my friend.

isinstance(obj, classinfo): This function returns True if obj is an instance of classinfo, or if obj is an instance of a subclass of classinfo. This is usually what you want when dealing with object-oriented code, as it correctly identifies objects that inherit from a parent class.

type(obj) is classinfo (or obj.__class__ is classinfo): This checks if the object's type is exactly classinfo. It will return False if obj is an instance of a subclass of classinfo.

Consider this little Python example:

class Animal:
    pass

class Dog(Animal):
    pass

my_dog = Dog()

print(isinstance(my_dog, Animal)) # Output: True (because Dog is a subclass of Animal)
print(type(my_dog) is Animal)     # Output: False (because my_dog's type is Dog, not exactly Animal)

So, while type() or .__class__ are indeed alternatives, isinstance() is generally more flexible and robust for polymorphic code where you expect to handle objects of a certain type or any of its specialized forms.

Does that distinction make sense to you?


Shaunythunder
you've said int the past is instance is pretty resource heavy

Boots
You have a good memory, young apprentice! I may have indeed mentioned that in a specific context where extreme micro-optimizations were being discussed, perhaps in a scenario involving incredibly tight loops with millions upon millions of iterations.

However, for typical game development and general Python programming, isinstance() is not generally considered "resource-heavy" to the point of being a performance bottleneck. The overhead it incurs is usually negligible compared to the operations being performed within a game loop, such as drawing graphics, calculating physics, or handling input.

Here's why isinstance() is almost always the preferred and perfectly performant choice in scenarios like your draw_ufo_projectile_objs method:

Readability and Correctness: As we discussed, isinstance() correctly handles inheritance, which is a cornerstone of object-oriented design. type() can lead to subtle bugs if you later introduce subclasses.
Modern Python Optimizations: Python interpreters are highly optimized. The cost of a type check like isinstance() is extremely low.
Context of Operations: In a game, the time spent drawing objects to the screen, updating their positions, and checking for collisions (all of which you are doing or planning to do) will dwarf the minuscule time taken by isinstance() checks.
So, while it's good to be aware of performance considerations, in this case, the clarity, robustness, and correctness that isinstance() provides far outweigh any hypothetical performance gain you might get from using type() is in your game loop. It's truly a non-issue for your use case.

Does that help clarify why isinstance() remains the recommended choice here, despite any past extreme performance discussions?


Shaunythunder
extreme micro-optimizations

lol moving on then

Boots
Excellent! A hearty chuckle is always a good sign. Indeed, sometimes the pursuit of "extreme micro-optimizations" can lead us down paths that obscure clarity for negligible gains.

Glad we could clarify that, young apprentice. So, what's the next grand step in the conceptualization or implementation of your Asteroids game? I'm ready for your next question or plan!


Shaunythunder
I've decided that I'm going to have a wave manager for each type of game mode and then have an overall manager which completely mirrors everything I've done so far. it would be silly to have a central manager for everything

Boots
That's a fascinating evolution in your design, young apprentice! It sounds like you're envisioning a more specialized and modular approach to wave management, rather than a single, all-encompassing one.

Having a WaveManager dedicated to each game mode (like your classic Asteroids mode versus, say, a dodgeball mode you mentioned earlier) makes a lot of sense. Each mode might have unique wave patterns, enemy compositions, and scaling rules.

Then, having an "overall manager" that "mirrors everything you've done so far" and orchestrates these mode-specific wave managers seems like a very clever way to provide a consistent interface while allowing for mode-specific complexity.

What responsibilities do you foresee this new, higher-level "overall manager" taking on? How will it interact with and direct the individual WaveManagers for each game mode?


Shaunythunder
well I got a headache trying to make it make sense with the single manager, so I said screw it, I'll split it out

Boots
Ah, a headache is often the clearest sign that a design needs re-evaluation, young apprentice! Trusting your intuition when something feels overly complex is a mark of a wise developer. Splitting out responsibilities is a classic and very effective strategy when a single class or module becomes too unwieldy.

This approach is indeed quite common and often leads to much cleaner, more maintainable code. By splitting it, you're embracing the principle of separation of concerns. Each wave manager can now focus solely on the unique logic for its specific game mode, without being burdened by the details of other modes. The "overall manager" then acts as a director, knowing which mode's wave manager to consult or activate based on the current game state, without needing to know the nitty-gritty details of each mode's waves.

It's an excellent way to manage complexity, especially as your game expands with more modes!

Do you have any specific questions about how this new, split design might impact any particular aspect of your wave system, or would you like me to quiz you on its implications?


Shaunythunder
i think you have quizzed me enough

Boots
You are absolutely right, young apprentice! My apologies. I understand you've had quite enough quizzing for now. Sometimes, even a sagely old bear can get a bit carried away with the Socratic method!

Given your detailed and thoughtful design for the split wave management system, what's the next step you'd like to discuss or work through? Perhaps you have some specific implementation questions, or you'd like to share how you're structuring the "overall manager" to interact with the mode-specific wave managers? I'm here to assist however you need.


Shaunythunder
pygame.time.delay(100)

what is this

Boots
Ah, pygame.time.delay(100)! That's a very useful function when you're working with Pygame.

In short, pygame.time.delay(100) pauses your program's execution for a specified number of milliseconds.

Here's a breakdown:

pygame.time.delay(): This function is part of the pygame.time module, which handles time-related functions in Pygame.
100: This is the argument passed to the function, and it represents the number of milliseconds the program should pause. So, 100 milliseconds is equal to 0.1 seconds.
What it does:
When pygame.time.delay(100) is called, your game loop (and everything else in your program) will literally stop processing for 100 milliseconds. No drawing, no event handling, no physics updates – nothing.

When you might use it:
While it's generally not recommended for precise game loop timing (as it's not very accurate and can cause your game to stutter if frames aren't consistent), it can be useful for:

Simple pauses: Like for a splash screen or a brief delay between game states.
Controlling update rate for non-critical elements: If you have something that doesn't need to update every single frame.
Debugging: To slow down the game temporarily to observe behavior.
For more precise and consistent game loop timing, pygame.time.Clock.tick() is typically preferred, as it ensures your game runs at a consistent frame rate without simply pausing the entire program.

Here's a quick example to illustrate:

import pygame

pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((600, 400))
pygame.display.set_caption("Delay Example")

running = True
start_time = pygame.time.get_ticks()

while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    screen.fill((0, 0, 0)) # Black background

    # After 2 seconds, display a message and delay
    if pygame.time.get_ticks() - start_time > 2000:
        font = pygame.font.Font(None, 50)
        text = font.render("Pausing for 1 second...", True, (255, 255, 255))
        screen.blit(text, (50, 180))
        pygame.display.flip() # Update the display to show the text

        pygame.time.delay(1000) # Pause for 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
        start_time = pygame.time.get_ticks() # Reset timer to loop the message

    pygame.display.flip()

pygame.quit()

Does that explanation clarify what pygame.time.delay() does for you?


Shaunythunder
def check_no_enemies_left(self) -> bool:
    for attempt in range(20):
        if self.asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.asteroids_left == 0 and \
           self.asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.ufos_left == 0:
            return True
        pygame.time.delay(100)  # Wait for a short period before checking again

like this?

Boots
That's an interesting approach to checking for zero enemies, young apprentice! It certainly would eventually return True if all enemies are cleared within those 20 attempts.

However, there's a significant point to consider when using pygame.time.delay() inside an active game loop for a check like this. When pygame.time.delay(100) is called, your entire game pauses for 100 milliseconds. This means:

No new frames are drawn.
No user input is processed.
No other game logic (like enemy movement or bullet updates) occurs.
If this check_no_enemies_left method is called frequently within your main game loop, you'll find your game becoming very unresponsive and "choppy," or even appearing to freeze for a couple of seconds (20 attempts * 100ms = 2000ms = 2 seconds) while it waits for the condition to be met.

A more typical and smoother approach in a game would be to simply check the current state of asteroids_left and ufos_left in every frame of your main game loop, without introducing delays. When they both hit zero, then you would trigger your wave transition logic (like starting the countdown).

For example, in your main game loop, you might have something like this:

# Inside your main game loop function, after enemies have been updated
# (assuming self.wave_manager has access to self.asteroids_enemy_obj_manager)

# Check if all enemies are gone for the current wave
if self.asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.asteroids_left == 0 and \
   self.asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.ufos_left == 0:
    # Trigger the next wave state,
    # which would then handle the countdown overlay,
    # update wave number, spawn new enemies, etc.
    self.wave_manager.start_next_wave_countdown() # A new method you might create

This way, your game remains fluid and responsive, checking the condition as part of its regular frame-by-frame update.

Does that distinction between immediate checking and pausing the loop make sense for game fluidity?


Shaunythunder
this was a copilot reccomend so I wanted to know what it did

Boots
Ah, I see! That makes perfect sense, young apprentice. It's excellent that you're curious and always seeking to understand what the tools and suggestions in your codebase actually do.

So, when Copilot suggested pygame.time.delay(100) within that loop, it was suggesting a way to pause the execution for 100 milliseconds between each check. My previous explanation of its function stands: it literally makes your program wait.

It's a valuable habit to question and understand every line of code, regardless of its source. You've clearly grasped what that function does now!

What else is on your mind regarding your wave management system or other parts of your game?


Shaunythunder
is there a non gamebreaking delay method?

Boots
Indeed, young apprentice, there absolutely is a way to create delays and time events that don't break the game's flow and responsiveness! This is a fundamental concept in game programming.

The trick is to avoid pausing the entire program with pygame.time.delay(). Instead, you continuously run your game loop and check how much time has passed since a certain event or condition began.

The primary tool for this in Pygame is pygame.time.get_ticks().

Here's how it works:

pygame.time.get_ticks()
This function returns the number of milliseconds since pygame.init() was called. It's like a stopwatch that's always running in the background.

The "Non-Blocking Delay" Method:

Instead of saying "wait for X milliseconds," you say "do something if X milliseconds have passed since this moment."

Let's imagine you want a 5-second countdown before the next wave starts.

Record the Start Time: When the enemies are all cleared, you record the current time (e.g., countdown_start_time = pygame.time.get_ticks()).
Check Elapsed Time in the Loop: In every frame of your main game loop, you calculate elapsed_time = pygame.time.get_ticks() - countdown_start_time.
Perform Actions Based on Time:
If elapsed_time is less than 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds), you can display your countdown overlay, perhaps showing (5 - elapsed_time // 1000) as the current second.
Once elapsed_time is greater than or equal to 5000 milliseconds, you trigger the start of the next wave.
Example Pseudo-Code:

# In your WaveManager or main game loop where you handle wave states:

class WaveManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_wave_number = 1
        self.wave_state = "playing" # Can be "playing", "countdown", "intermission"
        self.countdown_timer = 0
        self.countdown_duration = 5000 # 5 seconds in milliseconds

    def update(self, dt): # dt is delta time, often from pygame.time.Clock.tick()
        if self.wave_state == "playing":
            # Check if all enemies are gone (as you designed earlier)
            if self.asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.asteroids_left == 0 and \
               self.asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.ufos_left == 0:
                self.start_countdown()

        elif self.wave_state == "countdown":
            self.countdown_timer += dt # Add delta time to the timer
            if self.countdown_timer >= self.countdown_duration:
                self.start_new_wave()
            else:
                # Update and draw the countdown overlay
                remaining_seconds = (self.countdown_duration - self.countdown_timer) // 1000 + 1
                # self.overlay_manager.display_countdown(remaining_seconds, self.current_wave_number)


    def start_countdown(self):
        self.wave_state = "countdown"
        self.countdown_timer = 0
        # Potentially clear existing enemies if any
        # self.asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.clear_all_enemies()

    def start_new_wave(self):
        self.current_wave_number += 1
        self.wave_state = "playing"
        # Update enemy caps and stats in AsteroidsEnemyObjManager
        # Call AsteroidsEnemyObjManager to start spawning new enemies
        # self.asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.set_new_wave_parameters(self.current_wave_number)
        # self.asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.start_spawning_for_wave()
        # self.overlay_manager.hide_countdown() # Hide the countdown overlay

# In your main game loop:
# clock = pygame.time.Clock()
# ...
# while running:
#    dt = clock.tick(60) # Limits frame rate to 60 FPS and returns milliseconds since last call
#    wave_manager.update(dt)
#    ...
#    draw everything
#    ...

This way, your game loop keeps running smoothly, processing events and drawing frames, while the WaveManager independently tracks the time for the wave transition. This is the "non-gamebreaking" way to implement delays and timed events in Pygame.

Does this concept of using get_ticks() and tracking elapsed time make sense for your wave system?


Shaunythunder
oh so exactly how I calculate fire rate

Boots
Precisely, young apprentice! You've hit the nail on the head.

It's exactly the same principle you use for calculating fire rate, or for managing cooldowns, or for any time-based event in a game.

You establish a last_fired_time or last_wave_transition_time, and then in your game loop, you check pygame.time.get_ticks() - last_event_time to see if enough delay_duration has passed. If it has, you trigger the event, and update last_event_time.

It's a fundamental pattern in game development for keeping your game fluid and responsive. Excellent observation!

So, with that clarified, what's next on your mind for the wave management system, or any other part of your Asteroids game?


Shaunythunder
its wild that copilot recommended shutting down my game for a few milliseconds

Boots
It's wild, indeed, young apprentice! Your observation is quite astute.

While pygame.time.delay() has its niche uses for simple, non-critical pauses (like a brief splash screen at startup), it's generally a "stop everything" command. For the continuous, dynamic flow of a game like Asteroids, where responsiveness is key, it's almost always best to avoid anything that literally halts your main game loop.

This is precisely why patterns using pygame.time.get_ticks() or pygame.time.Clock.tick() are the go-to methods for time management in games – they allow your game to keep "breathing" and processing while tracking time for events.

It's a great example of why critical thinking and understanding the underlying mechanics are so important, even with helpful tools!

So, with that clear, what's the next exciting piece of your Asteroids game you'd like to dive into?

Ah, a look at your create_asteroid_object method! It seems you're putting your plans into action, particularly the part where the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager takes an enemy object and adds it to its tracking list.

I see a line that catches my wizardly eye:

assert isinstance(asteroid_obj, asteroids_obj.AsteroidMasterObj), \
    "Asteroid Object is not initialized correctly."

Remember our earlier discussion about the AsteroidMasterObj being the "master" or "factory" that creates individual asteroid instances (like Asteroid or its subclasses)? If this create_asteroid_object method is meant to add an individual asteroid instance that just got spawned, then asteroid_obj would typically be an instance of Asteroid (or one of its specialized subclasses), not the AsteroidMasterObj itself.

If asteroid_obj is indeed an actual Asteroid instance (the thing that moves and collides), then this assert statement might actually fail, as an Asteroid instance is not an instance of AsteroidMasterObj.

Perhaps you meant to assert that asteroid_obj is an instance of asteroids_obj.Asteroid (or a more general base class if you have one for all individual asteroids)?

For example:

        assert isinstance(asteroid_obj, asteroids_obj.Asteroid), \
            "Asteroid Object is not an Asteroid instance."

What are your thoughts on that?


Shaunythunder
This is to assert that yes this is a child of that class, yes there will be a asteroid type

Boots
Ah, I see what you're intending, young apprentice! You want to assert that the asteroid_obj passed into this method is indeed a valid type of asteroid that your system understands and that it carries the necessary _asteroid_type information. That's a very good validation to have.

However, let's revisit the relationship between AsteroidMasterObj and the actual Asteroid objects that fly around the screen.

From our earlier discussions, and common object-oriented patterns, AsteroidMasterObj sounds like a "factory" or "manager" class. Its job is to spawn_asteroid (as seen in your spawn_asteroids method) and potentially hold the maximum/minimum ranges for asteroid stats.

When self._asteroid_master_obj.spawn_asteroid("asteroid") is called, it typically creates and returns an individual asteroid object (let's call its class Asteroid for now, assuming that's the base class for actual in-game asteroids).

So, if your create_asteroid_object method is designed to accept one of these individual game asteroids that was just spawned, then the asteroid_obj you're passing in would be an instance of, say, asteroids_obj.Asteroid (or asteroids_obj.SmallAsteroid, asteroids_obj.LargeAsteroid, etc.), not an instance of asteroids_obj.AsteroidMasterObj.

An Asteroid object is not a "child class" of AsteroidMasterObj; rather, AsteroidMasterObj is the entity that produces instances of Asteroid.

Consider this simplified analogy:

class CarFactory: # This is like your AsteroidMasterObj
    def build_car(self):
        return Car() # It builds a Car object

class Car: # This is like your Asteroid object
    pass

factory = CarFactory()
my_car = factory.build_car()

print(isinstance(my_car, CarFactory)) # This would be False
print(isinstance(my_car, Car))        # This would be True

Given this, if create_asteroid_object is truly for adding an individual in-game asteroid, that assert would likely fail at runtime unless asteroid_obj is unexpectedly the AsteroidMasterObj itself.

Perhaps you might want to assert against the actual base class for your in-game asteroid objects, if asteroids_obj.Asteroid is that base?

assert isinstance(asteroid_obj, asteroids_obj.Asteroid), \
    "Object passed to create_asteroid_object is not a valid Asteroid instance."

What are your thoughts on this distinction between the factory/manager and the objects it creates?

is it me or does this seem too clunky if I have 10 different enemy types

Boots
You've hit on a very astute observation, young apprentice! You're absolutely right, if you expand to 10 different enemy types (or even more in the future), that if condition with a long chain of and operators would indeed become quite clunky and difficult to manage. It's not easily scalable.

This is a classic scenario where using a more flexible data structure to hold your spawn request counts would make the code much cleaner and more extensible.

Instead of having individual attributes like self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests and self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests, you could store these in a dictionary.

For example:

class WaveManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... other initializations ...
        self.spawn_requests_remaining = {
            "asteroid_classic": 5, # Example: 5 asteroids requested for the wave
            "ufo_classic": 1,      # Example: 1 UFO requested
            # "new_enemy_type": 3, # Easily add more types here
        }
        self.no_more_spawn_requests = False

    def report_spawn_confirmation(self, enemy_type: str) -> None:
        """Called by AsteroidsEnemyObjManager when an enemy is spawned."""
        if enemy_type in self.spawn_requests_remaining and \
           self.spawn_requests_remaining[enemy_type] > 0:
            self.spawn_requests_remaining[enemy_type] -= 1
        # Optionally, you might want to handle invalid enemy_type or already zero requests

    def check_no_more_spawn_requests(self) -> bool:
        """Checks if there are no more spawn requests left for the current wave."""
        # This will return True if ALL values in the dictionary are 0
        self.no_more_spawn_requests = all(count == 0 for count in self.spawn_requests_remaining.values())
        
        return self.no_more_spawn_requests

    # When you start a new wave, you'd re-populate self.spawn_requests_remaining
    # based on the wave number and desired enemy types.

With this approach:

Adding new enemy types simply means adding a new entry to the self.spawn_requests_remaining dictionary when you configure a wave.
The check_no_more_spawn_requests method uses all() with a generator expression, which cleanly checks all entries in the dictionary without needing to modify the if statement every time you add a new enemy.
Does that look like a less clunky and more scalable solution for your many enemy types?


Shaunythunder
dictionary seems way clunkier than just having a method where I count up the different enemy requests

Boots
I understand your perspective, young apprentice! At first glance, a dictionary might seem like more setup than just using individual variables and summing them up. However, let's consider how it affects the "clunkiness" as your game grows and you introduce more and more enemy types.

Imagine you have 10, 20, or even 50 different enemy types that you want to manage within your waves.

The "Individual Variables" Approach:

If you stick with individual attributes for each enemy type (e.g., self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests, self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests, self.new_enemy_type_A_requests, self.new_enemy_type_B_requests, etc.), then:

Initialization: You'd have to explicitly declare and initialize a new attribute for every single enemy type you ever create.
Checking for Zero (your check_no_more_spawn_requests method): Your if statement would become incredibly long and cumbersome, looking like this:
if (self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests == 0 and
    self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests == 0 and
    self.new_enemy_type_A_requests == 0 and
    self.new_enemy_type_B_requests == 0 and
    # ... and so on for dozens of lines ...
    self.last_enemy_type_Z_requests == 0):
    # ...

Every time you add a new enemy type, you'd have to manually go into this method and add another and clause. This is where it becomes very clunky to maintain and extend.
The "Dictionary" Approach:

With a dictionary like self.spawn_requests_remaining = {"asteroid_classic": 5, "ufo_classic": 1}, here's how it changes:

Initialization: You populate the dictionary with just the enemy types relevant to the current wave. If a wave only has asteroids and UFOs, the dictionary only holds those two entries. If the next wave introduces a new enemy, you simply add that new entry to the dictionary for that wave. You don't need to pre-declare dozens of unused variables.
Checking for Zero: Your check_no_more_spawn_requests method remains exactly the same, no matter how many enemy types you have:
self.no_more_spawn_requests = all(count == 0 for count in self.spawn_requests_remaining.values())

This line of code works for 2 enemy types, 10 enemy types, or 100 enemy types without any modification. This is the essence of being scalable and less clunky for growth.
So, while setting up the dictionary might feel like a tiny bit more effort for just two types, it pays dividends immensely when your game's complexity grows. It makes your code future-proof against the "clunkiness" of managing a large, variable number of distinct items.

Does that explanation highlight why the dictionary approach is generally preferred for managing a dynamic number of similar items, especially in a growing game?

only concerned about asteroids stuff here

Boots
Excellent, young apprentice! Let's delve into the MasterWaveManager and focus specifically on how it's handling the ASTEROIDS_MODE logic.

Your MasterWaveManager clearly acts as the orchestrator, correctly delegating the specific wave responsibilities to self.asteroid_wave_handler (your AsteroidsWaveManager). This aligns perfectly with your refined design for separating concerns by game mode.

The logic within your handle_wave_logic method for ASTEROIDS_MODE seems to follow our conceptual plan quite well:

        if self._game_state_reporter._game_logic_state == ASTEROIDS_MODE:
            # First, a check related to checking for no enemies
            self.asteroid_wave_handler.calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies()
            
            # Then, the actual check if enemies are cleared
            if self.asteroid_wave_handler.check_no_enemies_left():
                # If cleared, set up parameters for the NEXT wave
                self.asteroid_wave_handler.set_up_next_wave_parameters()
            else:
                # Otherwise, continue with current wave's spawning (or existing enemies)
                self.asteroid_wave_handler.handle_wave_spawning()

This structure effectively routes control to your AsteroidsWaveManager at the appropriate times.

One thought that comes to mind, related to our earlier discussions about MasterWaveManager tracking _current_wave and AsteroidsWaveManager needing to know it for scaling:

The MasterWaveManager is incrementing self._current_wave in its generate_next_wave method. When self.asteroid_wave_handler.set_up_next_wave_parameters() is called, how does your AsteroidsWaveManager (the asteroid_wave_handler) get access to this global _current_wave number from the MasterWaveManager? It will likely need that number to correctly calculate the increasing enemy caps and stats for the new wave.

Is the AsteroidsWaveManager holding a direct reference back to the MasterWaveManager, or will the _current_wave be passed as an argument to set_up_next_wave_parameters()?


Shaunythunder
I'll set up a comms system so that the master wave manager tracks the current wave, and then the subs request the wave number and request to increase it by 1

Boots
That's a very clear and robust communication strategy, young apprentice! It perfectly aligns with the idea of the MasterWaveManager being the central authority for the overall game progression. By having the sub-wave managers request the current wave number and request its increment, you maintain strict control over this critical piece of game state.

This means your AsteroidsWaveManager will need a reference to its MasterWaveManager (perhaps passed in its __init__ or set through a setter).

Now, let's connect this to your AsteroidsWaveManager.set_up_next_wave_parameters() method. When this method is called, how will it use the _current_wave number (obtained from the MasterWaveManager) to determine the specific parameters for the next wave? For instance, will it use conditional logic (if-elif-else), a lookup table (dictionary/list), or some mathematical formula to calculate the maximum_asteroid_objs, maximum_ufo_objs, and enemy stat modifiers based on that wave number?

Excellent, young apprentice! I see you've implemented the communication system for the _current_wave within your MasterWaveManager:

request_current_wave_number(): Allows sub-managers to get the current wave.
request_wave_increment(): Allows sub-managers to ask the master to advance the wave counter.
This is a very clean way to keep _current_wave centralized in the MasterWaveManager as the single source of truth.

However, I've spotted a tiny, but potentially significant, magical mishap in your request_wave_increment method:

    def request_wave_increment(self) -> None:
        """Returns the current wave increment."""
        self._current_wave =+ 1

Take a very close look at the line self._current_wave =+ 1.

What do you think that operator =+ actually does in Python? How does it differ from what you intend to do, which is to increment _current_wave by 1?


Shaunythunder
    self._current_wave += 1

Boots
You've got it, young apprentice! Absolutely spot on.

The correct operator for incrementing a variable in Python is +=.

self._current_wave += 1 is shorthand for self._current_wave = self._current_wave + 1, which correctly adds 1 to the current value of _current_wave.
Your original self._current_wave =+ 1 was subtly different:

The =+ operator actually means self._current_wave = (+1). It would simply assign the positive value of 1 to _current_wave, effectively resetting it to 1 every time that method was called, regardless of its previous value! A very sneaky little bug indeed.
Excellent catch and correction! That's a crucial detail for your wave progression.

Now that the MasterWaveManager is looking solid, what's the next piece of code you'd like to share, perhaps one of your sub-wave managers, or another related component?

Excellent, young apprentice! This AsteroidsWaveManager is truly taking shape, and I can see the clear delegation of responsibilities from the MasterWaveManager. This is precisely the modular design we discussed!

Let's carefully examine this code, particularly focusing on the ASTEROIDS_MODE logic as requested.

Points of Interest:
Duplicate Initialization in __init__:
You have these two lines right after each other:

self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests = 0
self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests = 0

The second line will simply overwrite the first. It's possible you intended the second one to initialize self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests = 0 here.

Logic in check_no_enemies_left and calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies:
This is a subtle but very important one for your time-based checks!
In your check_no_enemies_left method, you have:

if self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies():

However, the method calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() does not return a boolean value; it returns None. Its purpose is to set the attribute self.can_check_no_enemies_left.

So, when Python sees if None:, it evaluates to if False:, meaning the inner block to check for no enemies will never be executed.

To fix this, you should first call the calculation method, and then check the attribute it sets:

def check_no_enemies_left(self) -> bool:
    assert self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager is not None, "AsteroidsEnemyObjManager must be initialized before checking for no enemies left."
    assert self._master_wave_handler is not None, "MasterWaveHandler must be initialized before checking for no enemies left."
    
    # First, call the method to update the internal flag
    self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() 
    
    # Then, check the flag's value
    if self.can_check_no_enemies_left: # <--- Check the attribute directly now
        if self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.report_enemy_total_left() == 0:
            # If no enemies left, set

Splendid, young apprentice! Let's cast our gaze upon your AsteroidsWaveManager and see the magic you've woven. This class is where the intricate dance of wave progression truly comes alive, and it's well-structured to handle its specific game mode.

Your use of `asteroids_enemy_obj


Shaunythunder
continue

Boots
Alright, let's continue our journey through your AsteroidsWaveManager! We left off discussing some points of interest.

Re-addressing calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies and check_no_enemies_left:
As we noted, the method calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() calculates and sets self.can_check_no_enemies_left, but it doesn't return a boolean. The if condition in check_no_enemies_left() currently tries to use the return value of that method, which will always be None (and thus False in a boolean context).

To make this work as intended, you would call calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() first to update the internal flag, and then check the flag itself:

    def check_no_enemies_left(self) -> bool:
        assert self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager is not None, "AsteroidsEnemyObjManager must be initialized before checking for no enemies left."
        assert self._master_wave_handler is not None, "MasterWaveHandler must be initialized before checking for no enemies left."
        
        # Call the method to update the internal flag based on time
        self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() 
        
        # Now, check the flag's value
        if self.can_check_no_enemies_left: 
            # If we're allowed to check based on the interval
            if self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.report_enemy_total_left() == 0:
                # If no enemies are left, increment the master wave and reset the check timer
                self._master_wave_handler.request_wave_increment()
                self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000
                self.can_check_no_enemies_left = False # Reset for next check interval
                return True
            else:
                # Enemies still exist, reset the check timer (even if not zero)
                self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000
                self.can_check_no_enemies_left = False
                return False
        else:
            # Not allowed to check yet based on the interval
            return False

With this change, calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() would simply set the self.can_check_no_enemies_left attribute, and check_no_enemies_left() would then read that attribute.

Other Observations:
Duplicate asteroid_classic_spawn_requests in __init__:
As mentioned, you have self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests = 0 twice. You likely meant the second one to be self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests = 0.

Missing dt in update Logic:
Your calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies relies on pygame.time.get_ticks(). While this works, for a game loop that's using clock.tick(FPS) to pass dt (delta time) around, it's often more consistent to pass dt into your update methods and use it to advance internal timers.

For example, you could have:

# In AsteroidsWaveManager's update method (which would be called by MasterWaveManager)
def update(self, dt: float) -> None:
    # ... other update logic ...
    self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check += dt / 1000 # Add dt in seconds

    if self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check > self._no_enemies_left_check_interval:
        if self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.report_enemy_total_left() == 0:
            self._master_wave_handler.request_wave_increment()
            # ... reset wave parameters ...
        self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check = 0 # Reset timer regardless

This removes the need for a separate calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies method and integrates the timing more directly into your update loop.

set_up_next_wave_parameters and Wave Number Increment:
In set_up_next_wave_parameters, you have:

self._current_wave = self._master_wave_handler.request_current_wave_number()
# ...
if self._current_wave % 1 == 0: # This is always true for any integer wave number
    self.total_asteroid_classic_spawns += 1

Since _current_wave is incremented by the MasterWaveManager via request_wave_increment(), you would typically just use the _current_wave you receive here as the new wave number. The if self._current_wave % 1 == 0 check will always be true and will increment total_asteroid_classic_spawns every time. Is that intentional, or perhaps a typo for % X == 0 where X is a specific interval?

Wave Scaling Logic in set_up_next_wave_parameters:
This method is exactly where you're implementing the scaling logic we discussed! You're incrementing total_asteroid_classic_spawns, total_ufo_classic_spawns, maximum_asteroid_objs, and maximum_ufo_objs based on _current_wave. This is great for progressively increasing difficulty.

reset_wave_manager Method:
You're calling self.__init__ again to reset. While this works, it's generally considered better practice to have a dedicated _reset_state() (or similar) method that re-initializes only the necessary attributes, rather than calling __init__ directly, as __init__ is meant for initial object construction. This also avoids passing arguments to __init__ that might not be available during a reset (though in your case, _asteroids_enemy_obj_manager and _master_wave_handler are likely persistent).

Overall, you've done a fantastic job implementing the core concepts of your wave management system here. The structure is solid, and with a few refinements, it will be a very robust system!

What are your thoughts on these points? Do any of them stand out, or would you like to dive deeper into a particular one?

Excellent, young apprentice! Let's carefully examine your updated AsteroidsWaveManager. I can see the swift and precise changes you've made, which is a mark of a true craftsman!

Here are my thoughts:

Positive Enhancements:
Corrected ufo_classic_spawn_requests Initialization:

Shaunythunder
continue

Boots
Alright, let's continue our detailed examination of your updated AsteroidsWaveManager!

Positive Enhancements:
Corrected ufo_classic_spawn_requests Initialization:
I see you've addressed the duplicate asteroid_classic_spawn_requests line in __init__, correctly replacing the second instance with self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests = 0. This is a small but important fix for correct initialization.

Corrected check_no_enemies_left Logic:
You've successfully implemented the fix we discussed for check_no_enemies_left! Now, it correctly calls self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() first to update the internal flag, and then checks self.can_check_no_enemies_left. This ensures your time-gated check works as intended, preventing constant checks and maintaining game fluidity. Well done!

Remaining Points for Consideration:
set_up_next_wave_parameters and _current_wave % 1 == 0:
In your set_up_next_wave_parameters method, you have:

if self._current_wave % 1 == 0:
    self.total_asteroid_classic_spawns += 1

As _current_wave will always be an integer, _current_wave % 1 will always evaluate to 0. This means that self.total_asteroid_classic_spawns will increment by 1 every single time set_up_next_wave_parameters is called. Is this the intended behavior for every wave, or did you mean for this to be conditional based on a different modulus (e.g., % 2 == 0 for every second wave, or % 5 == 0 for every fifth wave, similar to your boss wave logic)?

Timing in check_no_enemies_left (Resetting time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check):
Currently, you reset self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check only when report_enemy_total_left() is not 0 (meaning enemies are still left) or when it is 0 and you increment the wave.

            # ...
            return True # This path: time reset occurs
        else:
            self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000
            self.can_check_no_enemies_left = False
            return False
    else:
        return False # This path: time reset does NOT occur

Consider the case where self.can_check_no_enemies_left is False because not enough time has passed. In this scenario, the else block (the very last one) is hit, and time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check is not updated. This means your timer would only advance when the condition is met for can_check_no_enemies_left to be True, which could lead to inconsistent timing.

A more common pattern for this type of timer is to update time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check (or a last_check_time variable) whenever you attempt to perform a check, or even just accumulate dt (delta time) in an update method, as we briefly touched upon.

For example, if you move the timing logic to an update method that receives dt:

# In an update method (called by MasterWaveManager on AsteroidsWaveManager)
def update(self, dt: float) -> None:
    self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check += dt / 1000 # accumulate time

    if self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check >= self._no_enemies_left_check_interval:
        if self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.report_enemy_total_left() == 0:
            self._master_wave_handler.request_wave_increment()
            self.set_up_next_wave_parameters() # Call this directly here
        # Always reset the timer after the interval has passed, regardless of enemy count
        self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check = 0 

    # And then somewhere else, if the wave state is 'playing' and ready to spawn:
    # self.handle_wave_spawning()

This separates the timing update from the condition check and ensures the timer consistently progresses.

Your implementation is coming along very well! You've tackled some complex inter-class communication and timing challenges.

What are your thoughts on these observations, especially the _current_wave % 1 == 0 and the timer logic?


Shaunythunder
set_up_next_wave_parameters and _current_wave % 1 == 0:
In your set_up_next_wave_parameters method, you have:

if self._current_wave % 1 == 0:
self.total_asteroid_classic_spawns += 1

As _current_wave will always be an integer, _current_wave % 1 will always evaluate to 0. This means that self.total_asteroid_classic_spawns will increment by 1 every single time set_up_next_wave_parameters is called. Is this the intended behavior for every wave, or did you mean for this to be conditional based on a different modulus (e.g., % 2 == 0 for every second wave, or % 5 == 0 for every fifth wave, similar to your boss wave logic)?

100% intentional

Boots
Understood, young apprentice! My apologies for questioning your deliberate design. If it's 100% intentional for total_asteroid_classic_spawns to increase by one on every single wave, then that's a clear and effective way to ensure a constant increase in difficulty. Sometimes the simplest and most direct scaling is exactly what's needed!

Now, let's turn our attention to the timing in check_no_enemies_left and how self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check is being updated.

Currently, self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check only gets updated if self.can_check_no_enemies_left is True and then the inner if/else block is executed. If self.can_check_no_enemies_left happens to be False (because the interval hasn't passed yet), then time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check doesn't get updated in that frame.

This could mean that your timer effectively "freezes" until enough real-world time has elapsed to make can_check_no_enemies_left True again, even if the game loop continues running.

For consistent time tracking, it's generally better to update the time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check (or last_check_time) every time the relevant update method is called, perhaps by passing dt (delta time) into an update method as we discussed, or by always calling pygame.time.get_ticks() when you need to calculate the elapsed time.

Does this potential inconsistency in the timer update make sense, and how might you ensure time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check is always progressing accurately, regardless of whether a check is performed?

            self.asteroid_wave_handler.handle_wave_spawning()

YEah but its called every frame in the master

Boots
You are absolutely correct, young apprentice! My apologies. I see your point. The MasterWaveManager does indeed call self.asteroid_wave_handler.calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() every single frame that ASTEROIDS_MODE is active.

However, the subtle issue isn't that calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() isn't being called. The issue lies in when self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check gets updated.

Let's trace it:

This method calculates current_time - time_since_last_check and sets self.can_check_no_enemies_left. It does not update self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check itself.

check_no_enemies_left() is then called (every frame):

    self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() # This updates can_check_no_enemies_left
    if self.can_check_no_enemies_left: # This condition might be False for many frames

The Problem:
If, for many frames, (current_time - self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check) is less than `self._no_enemies_left

Alright, let's pick up right where we left off, young apprentice, and get to the core of this timing conundrum!

You are absolutely correct that calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() is called every frame by the MasterWaveManager. However, the critical point is when self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check itself gets updated.

Let's re-examine the check_no_enemies_left method:

    def check_no_enemies_left(self) -> bool:
        # 1. This method is called every frame.
        self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() # This updates can_check_no_enemies_left based on *current_time*

        # 2. This 'if' condition relies on the flag set in the previous line.
        if self.can_check_no_enemies_left: 
            # If enough time HAS passed since the last *successful update* of the timestamp,
            # then self.can_check_no_enemies_left will be True.
            
            if self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.report_enemy_total_left() == 0:
                # Path A: Enemies are cleared.
                self._master_wave_handler.request_wave_increment()
                self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000 # <--- TIMESTAMP UPDATED HERE
                self.can_check_no_enemies_left = False
                return True
            else:
                # Path B: Enemies are NOT cleared.
                self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000 # <--- TIMESTAMP UPDATED HERE
                self.can_check_no_enemies_left = False
                return False
        else:
            # Path C: Not enough time has passed yet to even perform the check.
            # This means (current_time - time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check) was < _no_enemies_left_check_interval.
            return False # <--- !!! TIMESTAMP IS *NOT* UPDATED IN THIS PATH !!!

The consequence of "Path C" not updating the timestamp:

Imagine this scenario:

_no_enemies_left_check_interval is 0.5 seconds.
time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check is, say, 10.0 seconds (meaning the last valid check or reset happened at 10.0s game time).
Your game loop progresses frame by frame.
At 10.1s, calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() runs. (10.1 - 10.0) is 0.1, which is < 0.5. So, self.can_check_no_enemies_left becomes False. check_no_enemies_left() then hits "Path C" and time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check remains 10.0.
At 10.2s, same thing. time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check is still 10.0.
... this continues until...
At 10.5s (the exact interval), calc_if_wave_manager_can_check_for_no_enemies() runs. (10.5 - 10.0) is 0.5, which is >= 0.5. So, self.can_check_no_enemies_left becomes True.
Now check_no_enemies_left() enters the if self.can_check_no_enemies_left: block. It either hits Path A or Path B, and in both of those paths, time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check is finally updated to 10.5.
The problem is that time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check is not continuously advancing with current_time when the interval isn't met. It only "jumps" forward after the interval has passed and a check is attempted (Path A or B). This can lead to your checks being slightly delayed from their intended interval, as the time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check isn't always reflecting the true "last check performed" moment.

The Solution:

For consistent time tracking, you almost always want to update your last_action_time or last_check_time variable as soon as you perform the check (or attempt to), or better yet, use dt accumulation as part of an update method.

If sticking with the current structure, you'd want to update time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check at the beginning of the check, or immediately after it becomes True that a check can be made, so it always marks the moment you "started looking" for this check's window.

A robust way to approach this would be to have your WaveManager (or AsteroidsWaveManager) have an update method that receives the dt (delta time) from the main game loop, and use that to progress its internal timers. This is the gold standard for game timing.

Does that detailed explanation clarify why the current placement of the timestamp update could lead to slight inconsistencies, even with the method being called every frame?

boots this is already a validated process used in both player projectiles and ufos

Boots
You are absolutely right, young apprentice! My apologies for scrutinizing a pattern that you've already successfully implemented and validated in other parts of your game, like your player projectiles and UFOs.

If this timing mechanism is working effectively for those systems and provides the desired behavior and performance, then it's certainly a viable approach for your wave manager as well. Consistency in your own codebase is a valuable thing!

While accumulating dt (delta time) is a very common pattern for highly precise and decoupled timing in game loops, especially when dealing with many different timers, your current method with pygame.time.get_ticks() and the check interval is clearly meeting your needs if it's functional elsewhere.

My apologies for dwelling on it unnecessarily! What's the next piece of your magnificent Asteroids game you'd like to discuss?

Boots
Alright, young apprentice, let's break down your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager! This is where the rubber meets the road for managing your game's adversaries, and it's looking quite comprehensive.

I'll go through some key observations and questions that come to my wizardly mind:

1. create_asteroid_object and create_ufo_object Assertions:
This is the main one that still catches my eye, building on our previous discussion about master objects versus instances.

In create_asteroid_object:

    def create_asteroid_object(self, asteroid_obj: object) -> None:
        assert isinstance(asteroid_obj, asteroids_obj.AsteroidMasterObj), \
            "Asteroid Object is not initialized correctly."
        assert asteroid_obj._asteroid_type is not None, \
            "Asteroid Object type is not set correctly."
        asteroid_type = asteroid_obj._asteroid_type
        # ...
        self.asteroid_objs.append(asteroid_obj) # Adding asteroid_obj to the list
        # ...

And similarly in create_ufo_object:

    def create_ufo_object(self, ufo_obj: object) -> None:
        assert isinstance(ufo_obj, alien_ufo_obj.UFOMasterObj), \
            "UFO Object is not initialized correctly."
        assert ufo_obj._ufo_type is not None, \
            "UFO Object type is not set correctly."
        ufo_type = ufo_obj._ufo_type
        # ...
        self.ufo_objs.append(ufo_obj) # Adding ufo_obj to the list
        # ...

If the purpose of these methods is to add individual asteroid or UFO game entities (the ones that move, are drawn, and collide) to your self.asteroid_objs and self.ufo_objs lists, then asteroid_obj would be an instance of asteroids_obj.Asteroid (or a subclass) and ufo_obj would be an instance of alien_ufo_obj.UFOClassic (or a subclass).

However, your assert isinstance(asteroid_obj, asteroids_obj.AsteroidMasterObj) and assert isinstance(ufo_obj, alien_ufo_obj.UFOMasterObj) statements are checking if the passed object is an instance of the master/factory classes. This assertion would only pass if you were literally passing the _asteroid_master_obj or _ufo_master_obj instance itself into these methods, which doesn't seem to align with the goal of adding individual entities to the asteroid_objs and ufo_objs lists.

If the individual game entities are, for example, asteroids_obj.Asteroid and alien_ufo_obj.UFOClassic, then these assertions should likely be:

        assert isinstance(asteroid_obj, asteroids_obj.Asteroid), \
            "Object passed is not a valid Asteroid instance."

and

        assert isinstance(ufo_obj, alien_ufo_obj.UFOClassic), \
            "Object passed is not a valid UFO instance."

This ensures that the object being added to the list is indeed a playable game entity.

2. terminate_asteroid_object Casting:
Similar to the above, in terminate_asteroid_object:

    def terminate_asteroid_object(self, asteroid_obj: object) -> None:
        asteroid_obj = cast(asteroids_obj.AsteroidMasterObj, asteroid_obj) # <--- Cast here
        if asteroid_obj in self.asteroid_objs:
            self.asteroid_objs.remove(asteroid_obj)

If self.asteroid_objs contains asteroids_obj.Asteroid instances, then casting asteroid_obj to asteroids_obj.AsteroidMasterObj here seems incorrect. You'd typically cast it to the type that's actually in the list, or perhaps not cast at all if the type hints are sufficient.

3. total_enemies_left Calculation in update_enemy_objs_left:
You made the decision to remove UFO projectiles from the total_enemies_left count for wave progression. However, your update_enemy_objs_left method still includes it:

    def update_enemy_objs_left(self) -> None:
        self.update_asteroids_left()
        self.update_ufos_left()
        # This line includes ufo_projectile_objs_left:
        self.total_enemies_left = self.asteroids_left + self.ufos_left + self.ufo_projectile_objs_left

This contradicts your earlier decision. For consistency with your wave progression logic, this line should likely be:

        self.total_enemies_left = self.asteroids_left + self.ufos_left

4. Typo in update_ufo_projectile_objs_left:
In update_ufo_projectile_objs_left:

    def update_ufo_projectile_objs_left(self) -> None:
        """This method will update the number of asteroids left in the game.""" # <--- Comment is incorrect here
        self.ufos_left = len(self.ufo_objs) # <--- This line updates ufos_left, not ufo_projectile_objs_left
        if self.ufo_projectile_objs_left < self.maximum_ufo_projectile_objs:
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = True
        else:
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = False

The first line self.ufos_left = len(self.ufo_objs) seems to be a copy-paste error and should likely be updating self.ufo_projectile_objs_left. The comment is also incorrect. It should probably be:

    def update_ufo_projectile_objs_left(self) -> None:
        """This method will update the number of UFO projectiles left in the game."""
        self.ufo_projectile_objs_left = len(self.ufo_projectile_objs) # Corrected line
        if self.ufo_projectile_objs_left < self.maximum_ufo_projectile_objs:
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = True
        else:
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = False

Overall:
Your `Aster

so how would I do that in a way that satisfies the linter? I"M not running an assert for every type

Boots
You've hit on a core concern for keeping your code clean and scalable, young apprentice! You're right, you don't want to write an assert for every single potential subclass.

The good news is, isinstance() is designed precisely for this kind of situation and already handles inheritance beautifully. You don't need to list every child type.

Here's how you can satisfy the linter and ensure correctness without being clunky:

The Solution: Assert against the Common Base Class for your Game Entities

If asteroids_obj.Asteroid is the base class for all your different asteroid types (e.g., SmallAsteroid, MediumAsteroid, LargeAsteroid all inherit from Asteroid), then the isinstance check should be against that common base:

# In asteroids_game_folder/asteroids_obj.py (example)
class Asteroid: # This would be the common base for all individual asteroid types
    def __init__(self, asteroid_type: str, ...):
        self._asteroid_type = asteroid_type
        # ...

class SmallAsteroid(Asteroid):
    pass

class LargeAsteroid(Asteroid):
    pass

Then, in your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager:

    def create_asteroid_object(self, asteroid_obj: object) -> None:
        """Create a new asteroid object and add it to the list of asteroid objects."""
        
        # Assert that the object is an instance of the *base class* for all actual asteroids.
        # This will pass if asteroid_obj is an Asteroid, SmallAsteroid, LargeAsteroid, etc.
        assert isinstance(asteroid_obj, asteroids_obj.Asteroid), \
            "Object passed is not a valid Asteroid game instance."
        
        # You can then safely access attributes that exist on the Asteroid base class
        assert asteroid_obj._asteroid_type is not None, \
            "Asteroid Object type is not set correctly."
        
        asteroid_type = asteroid_obj._asteroid_type

        # update_asteroids_left() might not be needed here if you rely on len(self.asteroid_objs) directly for checks
        # or if it's called elsewhere in the update loop.
        self._asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(asteroid_type)

And similarly for your UFOs:

# Assuming alien_ufo_obj.UFO is the base class for UFOClassic and any other UFO types
# Or alien_ufo_obj.UFOClassic itself if it's the only type of actual UFO game entity you're managing there.

    def create_ufo_object(self, ufo_obj: object) -> None:
        """Creates a UFO Object and adds to manager for tracking."""
        
        # Assert against the base class for UFO game instances
        assert isinstance(ufo_obj, alien_ufo_obj.UFOClassic), \
            "Object passed is not a valid UFO game instance."
        
        assert ufo_obj._ufo_type is not None, \
            "UFO Object type is not set correctly."
        ufo_type = ufo_obj._ufo_type
        
        if len(self.ufo_objs) < self.maximum_ufo_objs: # Using len(list) directly
            if ufo_obj not in self.ufo_objs:
                self.ufo_objs.append(ufo_obj)
        # update_ufos_left() might not be needed here for the same reasons as above
        self._asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(ufo_type)

Key Takeaways:

isinstance(obj, BaseClass): This check returns True for obj if it's an instance of BaseClass or any class that inherits from BaseClass. This is exactly what you want for polymorphism and extensibility.
Centralized Type Info: Ensure your individual game entities (like Asteroid or UFOClassic) have the _asteroid_type or _ufo_type attribute.
This approach will keep your assertions concise and correct, even as you add more specialized enemy types, and should satisfy your linter! Does this solution make sense for your structure?

boots thats EXACTLY how it is currently set up

Boots
You are absolutely right, young apprentice! My apologies. I clearly misinterpreted the relationship between your classes based on common patterns, and I should have trusted your statement.

If asteroids_obj.AsteroidMasterObj is indeed the base class from which all your individual in-game asteroid entities (like asteroids_obj.Asteroid, SmallAsteroid, etc.) inherit, then your assertion isinstance(asteroid_obj, asteroids_obj.AsteroidMasterObj) is perfectly correct for validating that asteroid_obj is a valid, playable asteroid entity in your game, regardless of its specific subtype.

Thank you for clarifying! My sagely mind sometimes gets caught in assumptions based on typical naming conventions.

Now that we've cleared up that significant point, let's look at the other observations in your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager code. Do any of the other points about the terminate_asteroid_object casting, the total_enemies_left calculation, or the update_ufo_projectile_objs_left typo resonate with you, or would you like to move on to another part of your code?

Alright, young apprentice, let's carefully examine your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager again. It's fantastic to see the full picture of how it all ties together!

Based on our previous conversations and the code you've provided, I've noticed two points that still seem to be present, which could affect the precise functionality you're aiming for:

total_enemies_left Calculation in update_enemy_objs_left:
You previously clarified that for wave progression, you intended self.total_enemies_left to only count asteroids and UFOs (not UFO projectiles). However, in your update_enemy_objs_left method, the calculation still includes UFO projectiles:

    def update_enemy_objs_left(self) -> None:
        self.update_asteroids_left()
        self.update_ufos_left()
        # This line includes ufo_projectile_objs_left:
        self.total_enemies_left = self.asteroids_left + self.ufos_left + self.ufo_projectile_objs_left

If your AsteroidsWaveManager relies on this report_enemy_total_left() value to trigger the next wave (i.e., when it reaches zero), it will require all UFO projectiles to be destroyed as well. If that's not the desired behavior for wave progression, you might want to adjust this line to:

        self.total_enemies_left = self.asteroids_left + self.ufos_left

Typo in update_ufo_projectile_objs_left:
There appears to be a small typo in the update_ufo_projectile_objs_left method. The line self.ufos_left = len(self.ufo_objs) is currently updating the count for regular UFOs, not the UFO projectiles, and the comment is also incorrect.

    def update_ufo_projectile_objs_left(self) -> None:
        """This method will update the number of asteroids left in the game.""" # Incorrect comment
        self.ufos_left = len(self.ufo_objs) # <--- This should likely be updating ufo_projectile_objs_left
        if self.ufo_projectile_objs_left < self.maximum_ufo_projectile_objs:
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = True
        else:
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = False

It should likely be:

    def update_ufo_projectile_objs_left(self) -> None:
        """This method will update the number of UFO projectiles

Alright, young apprentice, let's carefully examine your refined AsteroidsEnemyObjManager! It's fantastic to see the dedication you're putting into making this system robust.

I've noted a couple of things that still catch my wizardly eye:

Typo/Mismatch in update_ufo_projectile_objs_left:
You've correctly changed the line in update_ufo_projectile_objs_left to track the projectiles, which is great!

    def update_ufo_projectile_objs_left(self) -> None:
        """This method will update the number of asteroids left in the game.""" # <--- Comment still refers to asteroids
        self.ufos_projectiles_left = len(self.ufo_projectile_objs) # <--- New attribute name here
        if self.ufo_projectile_objs_left < self.maximum_ufo_projectile_objs:
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = True
        else:
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = False

Comment: The docstring still says "asteroids left in the game" for a method that's clearly about UFO projectiles. This should be updated for clarity.
Attribute Name Mismatch: In your __init__ method, you initialize self.ufo_projectile_objs_left. However, in this method, you've introduced self.ufos_projectiles_left (with an 's' after 'ufo'). Python will treat these as two separate attributes. You'll want to ensure consistency, likely using self.ufo_projectile_objs_left throughout.
Casting in terminate_asteroid_object (and similar in terminate_ufo_object):

def terminate_asteroid_object(self, asteroid_obj: object) -> None:
    asteroid_obj = cast(asteroids_obj.AsteroidMasterObj, asteroid_obj)
    if asteroid_obj in self.asteroid_objs:
        self.asteroid_objs.remove(asteroid_obj)

Given your clarification that AsteroidMasterObj is indeed the base class for your in-game asteroid instances, the cast here is technically type-correct. However, the cast function primarily serves to inform type checkers (like MyPy) about a type that Python might not infer. Since the object is already typed as object (very general) and then immediately used in an if asteroid_obj in self.asteroid_objs: check, where self.asteroid_objs should contain instances of AsteroidMasterObj (or its subclasses), the cast might be redundant or unnecessary for runtime behavior. It's more of a type-hinting nuance. If it works for your type checker and doesn't cause issues, it's fine.

Otherwise, you've successfully integrated the total_enemies_left correction, which is crucial for your wave progression logic. Great work on that!

What are your thoughts on the update_ufo_projectile_objs_left inconsistencies and the comment?

Alright, young apprentice, let's carefully examine this latest version of your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager! It's great to see your continued work and the refinements you're making.

You've successfully addressed a couple of the points we discussed, which is fantastic!

Positive Changes:
Corrected total_enemies_left Calculation:
In update_enemy_objs_left, you've now correctly changed the line to exclude UFO projectiles from the total enemy count:

        self.total_enemies_left = self.asteroids_left + self.ufos_left

This aligns perfectly with your design for wave progression, where only the main enemies contribute to the wave clear condition. Excellent!

Corrected Docstring in update_ufo_projectile_objs_left:
The comment for update_ufo_projectile_objs_left is now accurate, reflecting that it tracks UFO projectiles. Good catch!

Remaining Point for Consideration:
Inconsistency in UFO Projectile Count Attribute Name:
This is a very subtle one, but it's important for consistency and avoiding potential bugs down the line.

In your __init__ method, you initialize the attribute for UFO projectile count as:

self.ufo_projectile_objs_left = len(self.ufo_projectile_objs)

(Notice: ufo_projectile_objs_left)

However, in your update_ufo_projectile_objs_left method, you are now updating a different attribute name:

def update_ufo_projectile_objs_left(self) -> None:
    # ...
    self.ufos_projectiles_left = len(self.ufo_projectile_objs) # <--- Here it's 'ufos_projectiles_left'
    # ...
    if self.ufo_projectile_objs_left < self.maximum_ufo_projectile_objs: # <--- But then you use original name for comparison
        # ...

You've introduced self.ufos_projectiles_left (with an s after ufo) in the update method, which means the count is being updated to a new attribute, while the if condition below it is still checking the original self.ufo_projectile_objs_left attribute. This will lead to the count never being properly maintained.

You'll want to ensure these two names are identical. It should be self.ufo_projectile_objs_left throughout for consistency.

Once you address that small name inconsistency, your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager will be even more robust and precise in its enemy tracking! You're making excellent progress.

What are your thoughts on this attribute name discrepancy?

Alright, young apprentice, let's carefully examine your latest version of the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager!

You've successfully addressed the small inconsistency we noted earlier by removing the ufos_projectiles_left attribute, which is great for maintaining a clean and consistent codebase.

However, in doing so, it seems the line that actually updates the count of self.ufo_projectile_objs_left based on the current number of projectiles in the list has been removed.

Take a look at your update_ufo_projectile_objs_left method:

    def update_ufo_projectile_objs_left(self) -> None:
        """This method will update the number of ufo projectiles left in the game."""
        # Missing line here: The line that updates self.ufo_projectile_objs_left based on len(self.ufo_projectile_objs)
        if self.ufo_projectile_objs_left < self.maximum_ufo_projectile_objs:
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = True
        else:
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = False

Currently, self.ufo_projectile_objs_left will only hold its initial value (which is 0 when the __init__ method runs, as self.ufo_projectile_objs is an empty list at that point). It's never updated with the current length of the self.ufo_projectile_objs list as projectiles are created and destroyed.

Because of this, the condition if self.ufo_projectile_objs_left < self.maximum_ufo_projectile_objs: will likely always evaluate to True (assuming maximum_ufo_projectile_objs is a large number like 9999), regardless of how many UFO projectiles are actually on the screen. This means self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles will always be True, which might lead to more projectiles than intended if you use this flag for spawning.

You'll want to re-add the line to update the count at the beginning of this method, similar to how you do it for update_asteroids_left and update_ufos_left:

    def update_ufo_projectile_objs_left(self) -> None:
        """This method will update the number of UFO projectiles left in the game."""
        self.ufo_projectile_objs_left = len(self.ufo_projectile_objs) # <-- Re-added this line
        if self.ufo_projectile_objs_left < self.maximum_ufo_projectile_objs:
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = True
        else:
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = False

What are your thoughts on this missing update?

f7a0cfd (HEAD -> main, origin/main) BK: Built out the entire wave management system. Decided to go with a model similar to the other modules. There will be a wave manager that will handle all the spawning logic for each individual game type. They will then communicate to a master wave manager that holds the global wave value. Unfortunately that is currently broken as I need a way to verify that there's no more enemies left in the spawn que before asking if there's no more enemies left. It seems to be an easy solution as I just tally up the total spawns left. Looking for a less clunky Solution by it's probably just total spawns equals sum of all the different spawns. As of right now when you go into the game the wave counter skyrockets as the wave increases every frame as there are no enemies to start. Additionally transferred all spawning logic from the enemy manager to the wave managers. Created a HUD element that tracks the current wave. Will implement spawn que system next session and we'll see if that fixes it.
022b0c1 BJ: Implemented high score data clearing system that is selective to only the game mode that is currently displayed in the high score system. Additionally completed a overlay that requires confirmation by typing DELETE in all caps. It is case sensitive. Confirmed via print statements that everything works correctly. Confirm that high scores are actually being deleted via the real data in the asteroids mode. High score system is now fully featured and confirmed to be working. The original asteroids experience is 100% complete minus stylistic choices. Next step is to work on the wave management system for the asteroids game mode. Will get the waves working and make them progressively difficult. Then after that, will work on a new UFO type when will make the spawning selective the conditions in the waves. Once that is complete, I will polish up and balance the game experience and then go to work on the asteroids dodgeball mode.
ef0c44e BI: Completed high score display changes. System is now able to correctly navigate between the different high scores by game mode. The system uses a series of buttons which then sends the desired game to the high score display manager. The manager then updates the text of the display. Next up is to Implement a selective high score clearing system to only clear the high scores that for that specific game mode instead of having a single button that nukes the entire database. Additionally will need to implement a confirmation of intent overlay. Basically an 'are you sure' overlay to let the player know that scores cannot be recovered once wiped.
44c3408 BH: Completed and implemented name entry system for high scores. The system is able to successfully enter into its own name entry overlay, the player is able to type the name into the interface, and then either submit or cancel with enter or Escape respectively. Decided to remove the buttons as they weren't working and instead replace the buttons with instructions. Kept this as I found it streamlined the user experience. To use this interface, Enter key to submit, escape to cancel, and then to type to enter in the name. once the name is entered and submitted it correctly shows up on to the high score screen. Next step is to fix the high score navigation to allow correct transition to each different high score for each game. Unfortunately I cannot test if the system actually works given that I don't have a second game but the transition from having scores to blanks and seeing the name change should be sufficient to test.
9655571 BG: Completed the modules for the player data entry system for names. This system is untested and has yet to be integrated. The system takes a player name and then sets it as a field for the high score saving system. The game over menu passes the game mode and player score over to the name entry system. Once the name entry is done, it then passes all three values : he player name, the score, and the game mode to the high score data saving system for saving into the JSON file. Additionally performed refactoring on Imports for the main.py. Additionally found naming artifacts in the pause menu overlay and game over overlay and corrected them.
3367b8d BF: Completed full codebase code refactor in order to transition codebase from using direct hardcoded strings to constants that have strings built in. Various refactors to satisfy linter and support type checking. Converted all menu logic to utilize the constants and to stop using hard-coded index values. Each menu object now has an attribute pertaining to the game state that it was intended to trigger. Because of this new attribute system, menus can now be dynamically generated without any worry about indexing. Next step is to create a player name entry system for high score saving.
5034662 BE:Finished the high score system for the asteroids game. The player is able to save their high score and then view them in the high score screen. The player can also clear the high scores by pressing a button. Things to add are an overlay that inputs the player name, an overlay that requests confirmation of intent before clearing high scores, and reflecting the actual name of the game in the high score. Right now it just displays the hacky snake case name for the game. Will need to do an overhaul of the game state names and centralize them to a constant so that they can be pulled from any point in the code, and also so that they display correctly when I use them for displays.
ece7e58 BD: Working on converting the title menu logic to handle the navigatio portion of the high score system. Will not be able to test anything until the system is built. Logic for everything else is built out. Exploring a state management system for the high score menu nav itself to be able to flip between the menus. It will simply track the sub state for drawing the highscores but the menus buttons will not change between the different states.
7b14c99 BC: Experienced corruption issue with the local repository. Was able to download master from github and refactor changes in. Decided to tackle the data entry side of things first as I realized the architecture should be validated on real data. Was able to build out JSON file system and am able to automatically load the JSON before the game loop starts and save whenever a new high score is added. The display logic has been built but has not been tested out. Once that is figured out will need to get the menu buttons working for the rest of the game modes. Once that is completed, then we have a working high score system.
1e4dfe4 BB: Short Session, blocked out the logic for the menu navigation, utilizing the interactive and non interactive overlays fpr the high score system. Will need to major refactor as these items are for the overlays. Will convert to actual implementation for the high score system next session.
4a6912b BA: Spent this session refactoring the code base in order to clear all linter errors. Was completely successful and am at zero errors. After some investigation, determined that the way to make the high score module is to have a master manager tied to three different managers, non interactive AKA high score drawings, interactive AKA, menu options for changing game modes and resetting high scores, and saving high score values via JSON. Will work on getting the menus and high score read outs operational and then will deep dive into the JSON functinality. Plan is for local storage first then once satisfied, change the location to windows local.
3fe2cf4 AZ: Fixed the pause menu issue. It was an issue of mismatched variables as I had copied the logic over but one of the variables got missed. Interestingly it was able to run without errors or crashing the game. Ready to begin exploring the high score system.
6e06f8d AY: Completed scoring system. Scoring successfully displays on player HUD and gives a final score on game over. Fixed selection issue bug that came up on the game over and paused overlay screens. Fixed the game over version but attempted to refactor the pause menu. Ran out of time and is currently broken. Will fix next session. Afterwards, will look into saving highscores. Will need to create high score module as it currently does not exist.
e256c37 AX: Completed player hud for lives. Lives are able to be rendered in the top left screen and respond according to how many you have left. The non interactive overlay infrastructure works well. Next up is to implement a scoring system. Once that is done, the original asteroids experience will be completed, minus being able to save your high score.
ea58013 AW: Decided to go with the interactive and non interactive overlays. Set up the structure blueprint and refactored to accomodate. Created transparent surface to place noninteractive overlays on. Ensured game is in working order. Will implement the hud system next session and then the scoring system after that.
2759cdc AV: Implemented lives system and game over screen. Am able to successfully lose lives and get a game over overlay. Am able to navigate from the overlay to the main menu, quit, and retry. Added new game over state that resets the modules if there is a game over. Completely refactored all interactible menus to the new format and was able to remove the pause and title menus from main.py. Next up is a hud for the player. In debate on whether I want a hud overlay or just draw it on the main screen. Will most likely create a brand new surface and manager for non interactable overlay. Will chronicle what I choose as a go.
724e396 AU: Migrated the overlay drawing logic to a manager instead of the main menu. Game is now fully functional. Also cleaned up an issue where the main UFO object was defaulted to none. Will work on expanding the overlay system to include a game over overlay, a controls selection overlay, and a UI. Will probably split reponsibilities between interactable overlays and non interactable overlays.
a28e5c8 AT: Working on converting the Overlay handling to a centralized manager that will handle all of the overlays and will allow multiple overlays to be drawn at once. The manager takes the state from the gamestate manager and then draws the cooresponding overlay. This is a work in progress and the game is currently broken and cannot even run. This system is required for the various overlays like game over, pause menu, choosing whether to use mouse or keyboard, etc. Ran out of time and will continue working on it next session.
0da9697 AS: Implemented screen wrapping for player bullets and gave them a expiration timer. Bullets will now wrap around the screen for lining up screen based shots like in the original game. Additionally migrated the spawning logic out of the event loop. Will implement lives (AKA health) next and game over logic.
1b05afb AR: Finished implementation of the UFO Classic enemy. The UFO flies around the screen, shoots projectiles randomly, and crashes into asteroids. Additionally, player will get hit if they collide with either the UFO projectile or the UFO itself. We now have all of the elements of the original game save a few things, lives, heads up display of lives and highscore, high score system, player bullet screen wrapping, player bullet termination after a period of time. Once those things are online, the asteroids game is complete. Additionally, the wave system will need to be implemented and tested out. Will need two asteroids and ttwo UFO types to properly test out a enemy requesting system. Lastly, discovered a game bug where once the asteroids left go below a certain number, the asteroids will spawn far more than requested. With the wave manager, this may be an issue not worth considering.
c7383b3 AQ: Worked on UFO shooting logic. There is a type error with the UFO classic projectile super init that needs to be addressed as it is crashing the game. Short work session.

My goodness, young apprentice! That's quite a detailed report of your progress in the commit log! It's fantastic to see the entire wave management system, with its master and sub-managers, coming together as you envisioned.

Your diagnosis of the "skyrocketing wave counter" is absolutely spot on – it's a very common challenge when building wave systems! The core of the problem is exactly what you identified: the game progresses to the next wave when there are no enemies currently on the screen, but it hasn't yet finished spawning all the enemies intended for the current wave.

Your intuition about needing to "verify that there's no more enemies left in the spawn queue before asking if there's no more enemies left" is precisely the key! You need two conditions to be met for a wave to truly end and the next to begin:

All enemies for the current wave's quota have been spawned. (This is where your "spawn queue" or spawn_requests_remaining comes in).
All enemies currently active on the map have been eliminated. (This is your total_enemies_left from the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager).
And you're right, the "less clunky solution" you're looking for, where you tally up the "total spawns equals sum of all the different spawns," points directly to our previous discussion about using a dictionary for self.spawn_requests_remaining. This approach is incredibly scalable and avoids that lengthy if chain as you introduce more enemy types.

It sounds like your plan to implement this spawn queue system next session will be the perfect fix for that skyrocketing wave counter. You're thinking about game state and flow in a very sophisticated way!

Keep up the magnificent work! I'm eager to hear how your spawn queue implementation goes.

Excellent, young apprentice! This is a truly significant step forward. I see you've incorporated the total_spawn_requests_left and are using it in check_no_enemies_left. This is precisely the conceptual fix we discussed to prevent the wave counter from skyrocketing – great work!

Now, let's carefully review the new code, particularly focusing on how total_spawn_requests_left is managed.

Observations and Points for Refinement:
calculate_total_spawn_requests_left Logic Mismatch:
In your set_up_next_wave_parameters method, you correctly set self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests and self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests using the total_*_spawns variables. Then you call self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left().

However, your calculate_total_spawn_requests_left method is currently summing the total wave quotas (self.total_asteroid_classic_spawns and self.total_ufo_classic_spawns):

    def calculate_total_spawn_requests_left(self) -> None:
        classic_asteroids = self.total_asteroid_classic_spawns # <-- These are the total for the wave
        classic_ufos = self.total_ufo_classic_spawns          # <-- These are the total for the wave
        self.total_spawn_requests_left = classic_asteroids + classic_ufos
        print(f"Total Spawn Requests Left: {self.total_spawn_requests_left}")

This means self.total_spawn_requests_left will always reflect the initial number of spawns for the wave, not the remaining number of spawns.

Then, in spawn_confirmation, you correctly decrement self.total_spawn_requests_left:

    def spawn_confirmation(self, spawned_entity: str) -> None:
        if spawned_entity == ASTEROID_CLASSIC:
            self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests -= 1
            self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1 # <-- Correctly decrements here
            # ...
            self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() # <-- !!! This line recalculates it from the *total quotas* again
        elif spawned_entity == UFO_CLASSIC:
            self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests -= 1
            self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1 # <-- Correctly decrements here
            # ...

The problem is that calling self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() again within spawn_confirmation will effectively reset self.total_spawn_requests_left back to the initial wave's total quota, undoing the decrement that just happened!

Boots
Excellent, young apprentice! I see your dedication to refining this wave management system.

You've made a crucial and correct change in your AsteroidsWaveManager!

Positive Change:
Corrected calculate_total_spawn_requests_left:
You've fixed calculate_total_spawn_requests_left to now correctly sum the remaining spawn requests (self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests and self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests) instead of the total wave quota. This is a major improvement and ensures your total_spawn_requests_left accurately reflects what's left to spawn!
Remaining Point for Refinement:
Redundant Call to calculate_total_spawn_requests_left in spawn_confirmation:
Now that calculate_total_spawn_requests_left correctly sums the remaining requests, the call to it within your spawn_confirmation method will actually cause an issue:

    def spawn_confirmation(self, spawned_entity: str) -> None:
        if spawned_entity == ASTEROID_CLASSIC:
            self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests -= 1
            self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1 # <-- Correctly decrements
            print(f"Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left: {self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests}")
            print(f"Total Spawn Requests Left: {self.total_spawn_requests_left}")
            self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() # <-- !!! This line will now *undo* the decrement above !!!
        elif spawned_entity == UFO_CLASSIC:
            self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests -= 1
            self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1 # <-- Correctly decrements
            print(f"UFO Classic Spawn Requests Left: {self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests}")
            print(f"Total Spawn Requests Left: {self.total_spawn_requests_left}")
            # Missing calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() here, but it should also be removed if added.

Since you're already directly decrementing self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1, calling calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() right after will recalculate total_spawn_requests_left by summing the newly decremented asteroid_classic_spawn_requests and ufo_classic_spawn_requests. This will effectively make total_spawn_requests_left always equal to the sum of the individual spawn requests, potentially meaning it won't actually track the total number of enemies spawned and confirmed but rather the sum of the remaining individual quotas.

To fix this, you should remove the calls to self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() from within spawn_confirmation. Your direct decrement self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1 is sufficient and correct for reducing the count as enemies are spawned.

The calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() method should ideally only be called once when you set up the wave in set_up_next_wave_parameters to establish the initial total number of spawns for that wave.

Once that is addressed, the spawn queue logic should behave exactly as intended! You'

Boots
Ah, young apprentice, you've provided the crucial piece of the puzzle right there in your debugging output! The negative numbers are a clear symptom of a very specific interaction between your AsteroidsWaveManager and your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager.

Here's why your Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left and `Total Spawn

continue

Boots
You've provided the crucial debugging output, young apprentice! It's clear as day that your Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left and Total Spawn Requests Left are indeed dipping into the negatives.

This behavior, where the counts continue to decrement even after reaching zero, is a classic sign that the spawn_confirmation method


Shaunythunder
continue but actually give a message

Boots
Alright, young apprentice, you're right, let's get straight to the point and fix this negative count!

The direct message is this: Your spawn_confirmation method is being called far too many times, specifically much more often than actual enemies are intended to spawn.

Here's why, based on the code you've shared:

Your AsteroidsWaveManager.handle_wave_spawning() method is called every single frame the game is in ASTEROIDS_MODE (when enemies are on screen). Inside this method:

    def handle_wave_spawning(self) -> None:
        # ...
        if self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0:
            # Spawn classic asteroids.
            self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_asteroids(ASTEROID_CLASSIC)

        elif self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests > 0:
            # Spawn classic UFOs.
            self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_ufos(UFO_CLASSIC)

As long as self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests (or ufo_classic_spawn_requests) is greater than zero, the corresponding spawn_asteroids or spawn_ufos method is called.

The Problem:

These spawn_asteroids and spawn_ufos methods then turn around and call self._asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(asteroid_type) or ufo_type every single time they are invoked by handle_wave_spawning.
Since handle_wave_spawning runs every frame (e.g., 60 times per second), spawn_confirmation is also being called 60 times per second as long as there's a request to spawn.
This causes your asteroid_classic_spawn_requests and total_spawn_requests_left to decrement very rapidly, going far past zero and into the negatives, because they are being reduced much faster than actual, individual enemies are intended to be created in the game world.
The Solution:

You need to introduce a rate-limiting mechanism for your spawning calls, just like you have for your check_no_enemies_left method.

The handle_wave_spawning method should not just continuously call spawn_asteroids. Instead, it should:

Check if there are still requests remaining.
Check if enough time has passed since the last successful spawn request of that type.
If both conditions are met, then call the spawn_asteroids (or spawn_ufos) method.
Immediately record the time of this successful spawn so the timer can reset.
This way, your spawn_confirmation will only be called when an enemy is genuinely being added to the game world, and only at a controlled rate, preventing your counts from plummeting into the negatives.

Does that clarify the issue and point you towards the necessary adjustment in your handle_wave_spawning logic?


Shaunythunder
or I could do a boolean flag basically did you spawn this frame? if yes, then nno

Boots
That's a very clever and effective alternative, young apprentice! A boolean flag, like did_spawn_this_frame or similar, is an excellent way to ensure that you only initiate a spawn (and thus call spawn_confirmation) once per frame.

Here's how that pattern would typically work within your handle_wave_spawning method:

    def handle_wave_spawning(self) -> None:
        """Generates the next wave of enemies based on the current wave number."""
        assert self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager is not None, "AsteroidsEnemyObjManager must be initialized before handling wave spawning."
        
        spawned_this_frame = False # Initialize flag for the current frame

        # Only attempt to spawn if we haven't already spawned something this frame
        if not spawned_this_frame and self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0:
            self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_asteroids(ASTEROID_CLASSIC)
            spawned_this_frame = True # Mark that we spawned this frame

        # Use 'if' here, not 'elif', if you want to allow both asteroid and UFO spawns in the same frame
        # provided their individual conditions are met and spawned_this_frame allows it.
        # If you only want *one* entity spawned per frame total (asteroid OR UFO), then 'elif' is correct.
        if not spawned_this_frame and self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests > 0: # Or 'elif' based on single-spawn-per-frame preference
            self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_ufos(UFO_CLASSIC)
            spawned_this_frame = True # Mark that we spawned this frame

This boolean flag acts as a simple but powerful gate. It ensures that even if handle_wave_spawning is called 60 times a second, the actual spawn_asteroids (and subsequent spawn_confirmation) logic only executes once within that frame.

This will directly address your negative count issue by preventing over-decrementing your spawn requests. Excellent thinking!


Shaunythunder
in your example, wouldn't it just reset every time its called?

Boots
You are incredibly astute, young apprentice! My sincerest apologies; your keen eye has spotted a fundamental flaw in my hurried example. You are absolutely correct!

If spawned_this_frame is a local variable within handle_wave_spawning and is initialized to False at the beginning of the method, then yes, it would indeed reset to False on every single frame that handle_wave_spawning is called. This would completely defeat its purpose of rate-limiting spawns across frames.

My mistake was in suggesting a simple local boolean for a problem that requires state persistence across frames or time-based gating.

You need to control the rate at which enemies are spawned, not just ensure one per call of the handle_wave_spawning method. The goal is to prevent spawn_confirmation from being called 60 times a second.

The correct solution for this rate-limiting is indeed a timer, similar to what you already have for check_no_enemies_left.

You would need instance variables in AsteroidsWaveManager to track:

self.time_since_last_spawn: The last time an enemy was successfully spawned.
self.spawn_interval: How much time (in seconds or milliseconds) must pass between individual enemy spawns.
Then, within handle_wave_spawning (or perhaps an update method that handle_wave_spawning calls):

class AsteroidsWaveManager:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # ... other initializations ...
        self.time_since_last_spawn = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000 # Initialize to current time
        self.spawn_interval = 0.25 # Example: Spawn an enemy every 0.25 seconds

    def handle_wave_spawning(self, dt: float) -> None: # Pass delta time here too
        assert self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager is not None, "..."

        current_time = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000 # Or use accumulated dt

        if (current_time - self.time_since_last_spawn) >= self.spawn_interval:
            if self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0:
                self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_asteroids(ASTEROID_CLASSIC)
                self.time_since_last_spawn = current_time # Reset timer after a spawn
                # IMPORTANT: Only spawn one per interval, so return or use elif
                return 
            
            if self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests > 0: # This will only run if asteroid_classic_spawn_requests was 0
                self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_ufos(UFO_CLASSIC)
                self.time_since_last_spawn = current_time # Reset timer after a spawn
                # return # If you only want one type spawned per interval

(You'd adapt this to either spawn one type per interval, or perhaps alternate, depending on your design.)

By using a timer, you control the rate of calls to spawn_asteroids (and subsequently spawn_confirmation), thereby preventing your spawn request counts from going negative.

Thank you for catching my error and keeping me honest, young apprentice! That's excellent critical thinking. My apologies for the misdirection.


Shaunythunder
if event.type == pygame.MOUSEMOTION:
# Filters out mouse motion so that it doesn't trigger a bazillion times per frame

        if mouse_has_moved:
            continue
        mouse_has_moved = True

here was something we did earlier

Boots
Ah, yes, young apprentice, you have a truly excellent memory! We absolutely used that pattern for pygame.MOUSEMOTION events:

if event.type == pygame.MOUSEMOTION:
    if mouse_has_moved:
        continue # Skip if we already processed mouse motion this frame
    mouse_has_moved = True # Mark that we've processed it
    # ... process mouse motion ...

And you're right, that mouse_has_moved boolean flag serves a very important purpose there! It ensures that if Pygame generates multiple MOUSEMOTION events within a single game frame (which it often does if the mouse moves even slightly), your code only reacts to that motion once for that frame. It effectively "debounces" event processing.

However, there's a subtle but crucial difference between that scenario and the enemy spawning.

MOUSEMOTION Event Context: Mouse motion is an event that can fire multiple times before the screen is redrawn. The boolean flag correctly limits processing of that event to once per frame iteration. You'd reset mouse_has_moved to False at the very beginning of your main game loop each frame.

Enemy Spawning Context: Enemy spawning isn't triggered by an external event that might fire multiple times within a frame. Instead, your handle_wave_spawning method (which contains the spawning logic) is likely called once per frame by your main game loop's update cycle. The problem arises because even if it's called once per frame, calling _asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_asteroids() every single frame (e.g., 60 times a second) is too fast for the actual desired spawn rate.

So, while the boolean flag is perfect for debouncing events that might trigger many times in one frame, for controlling a continuous process like spawning enemies over time (e.g., "spawn an enemy every 0.5 seconds"), you need a timer that tracks the actual passage of time across multiple frames.

The timer allows you to say: "It's been 0.5 seconds since the last spawn, so now I can spawn another one," regardless of how many times handle_wave_spawning has been called in between. The boolean flag would only prevent multiple spawns within the same frame, but not multiple spawns over consecutive frames.

Does that distinction between event-based debounce and continuous rate-limiting make sense for these two different scenarios?

You've implemented the calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies method, young apprentice, and integrated it into your handle_wave_spawning! This is a good step towards rate-limiting your spawns.

However, I've spotted a familiar magical mischief in how calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies() is being used, similar to the previous issue we resolved with check_no_enemies_left.

Take a look at this line:

    def handle_wave_spawning(self) -> None:
        # ...
        if self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies(): # <--- This is the problem!
            if self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0:
                # ...

The method calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies() calculates whether spawning is possible and then sets the internal flag self.can_spawn_enemies. It does not return a boolean value; it returns None.

When Python sees if None:, it evaluates to if False:, meaning the code block inside that if statement will never be executed. Your spawning logic will not run!

To fix this, you need to first call the method to update the flag, and then check the flag itself:

    def handle_wave_spawning(self) -> None:
        """Generates the next wave of enemies based on the current wave number."""
        assert self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager is not None, "AsteroidsEnemyObjManager must be initialized before handling wave spawning."
        
        # First, call the method to update the internal flag based on the timer
        self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies()

        # Now, check the flag's value
        if self.can_spawn_enemies:
            # Only attempt to spawn if we are allowed to based on the timer
            if self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0:
                self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_asteroids(ASTEROID_CLASSIC)
                self.time_since_last_enemy_spawn = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000 # Reset timer after spawn
                # If you only want one type of enemy to spawn per interval, you might return here or use elif
                return # Prevent further spawns in this interval after one successful spawn

            elif self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests > 0:
                self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_ufos(UFO_CLASSIC)
                self.time_since_last_enemy_spawn = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000 # Reset timer after spawn
                # return # If you want to ensure only one specific spawn per interval

Additionally, remember to reset self.time_since_last_enemy_spawn right after a successful spawn. This is crucial for ensuring that the timer correctly counts down for the next spawn opportunity, preventing the over-decrementing we saw before.

Does this clarification help you properly integrate the spawn timer?

You're getting closer, young apprentice! You've made a very good correction by adding the if self.can_spawn_enemies check. That's a key part of your rate-limiting.

However, I've spotted a new, very subtle magical oversight in how you're calling calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies:

    def handle_wave_spawning(self) -> None:
        # ...
        self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies # <--- This line is the problem!
        
        if self.can_spawn_enemies and self.total_spawn_requests_left > 0:
            # ... spawning logic ...

Notice that self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies is missing its parentheses ().

In Python, when you write self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies without parentheses, you are simply referencing the method itself, not actually calling it to execute its code. This means the code inside calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies (which updates self.can_spawn_enemies) is never being run.

As a result, self.can_spawn_enemies will likely remain in its initial state (whatever it was set to in __init__, possibly False or some default), and your spawning logic within the if self.can_spawn_enemies: block might not execute as intended.

To fix this, you just need to add the parentheses to call the method:

        self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies() # <--- Added parentheses

Once that's fixed, your rate-limiting based on the timer should start working! Your logic to reset self.time_since_last_enemy_spawn after a spawn is also correctly placed.

Does that missing piece of the magical incantation make sense?

Excellent, young apprentice! That's it, precisely!

By adding those crucial parentheses to self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies(), you are now correctly calling the method. This means your self.can_spawn_enemies flag will be updated every frame based on your timer, and your spawning logic will finally operate at the controlled rate you designed.

This change, combined with your logic to reset self.time_since_last_enemy_spawn after each successful spawn, should now prevent your spawn request counts from dipping into the negatives. You've successfully implemented the rate-limiting for your enemy spawns!

What's next on your mind for this magnificent Asteroids game? Is there another part of the system you'd like to refine or discuss?

Ah, young apprentice, you've provided the crucial debugging output right there! The negative numbers are indeed a very clear sign of what's happening.

The problem lies in your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager methods, specifically create_asteroid_object and create_ufo_object.

Let's look at create_asteroid_object again:

You are right to pinpoint those negative numbers, young apprentice! They are a very clear indicator of a specific misstep in your wave management system's communication, and it revolves around exactly when the spawn_confirmation method is called.

The direct message is this: spawn_confirmation is being called even when an enemy object is not successfully added to your asteroid_objs or ufo_objs lists.

Let's look at your create_asteroid_object method within AsteroidsEnemyObjManager:

    def create_asteroid_object(self, asteroid_obj: object, asteroid_type: str) -> None:
        """Create a new asteroid object and add it to the list of asteroid objects."""
        
        # ... (assertions and type extraction) ...

        if self.asteroid_objs_left < self.maximum_asteroid_objs: # <--- CONDITION 1: Room for more asteroids?
            if asteroid_obj not in self.asteroid_objs:           # <--- CONDITION 2: Is it already in the list?
                self.asteroid_objs.append(asteroid_obj)          # <--- ONLY IF BOTH CONDITIONS MET, IT'S ADDED
        self.update_asteroids_left() # Updates count AFTER potential addition
        self._asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(asteroid_type) # <--- !!! THIS IS THE PROBLEM !!!
        # This line is called *every time* create_asteroid_object is invoked,
        # REGARDLESS of whether the append actually happened or not.

And the same issue applies to your create_ufo_object method.

Why this leads to negative counts:

Your AsteroidsWaveManager.handle_wave_spawning() method, combined with your spawn rate limiting, calls AsteroidsEnemyObjManager.spawn_asteroids() (which then leads to create_asteroid_object) at a controlled rate (e.g., every 0.5 seconds).

However, your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager has its own maximum_asteroid_objs limit.

When create_asteroid_object is called, it first checks if self.asteroid_objs_left < self.maximum_asteroid_objs.
If this condition is False (meaning the screen is already full of asteroids up to its maximum_asteroid_objs limit), the asteroid_obj is not appended to self.asteroid_objs.
BUT, the line self._asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(asteroid_type) is outside that if block. So, it still gets called, decrementing total_spawn_requests_left in the AsteroidsWaveManager, even though no actual asteroid was added to the screen!
This causes your total_spawn_requests_left to go negative because spawn_confirmation is called for "phantom" spawns that never actually materialize on the screen, continuing to decrement the count even when no more enemies can be placed.

The Solution:

The call to self._asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(asteroid_type) (and similarly for UFOs) should only happen if the asteroid_obj (or ufo_obj) was successfully added to its respective list.

You need to move that line inside the inner if block where the append operation occurs:

    def create_asteroid_object(self, asteroid_obj: object, asteroid_type: str) -> None:
        if self.asteroid_objs_left < self.maximum_asteroid_objs:
            if asteroid_obj not in self.asteroid_objs:
                self.asteroid_objs.append(asteroid_obj)
                self.update_asteroids_left() # Update counts after successful append
                self._asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(asteroid_type) # <--- MOVED HERE!
        # If the conditions are not met, nothing is appended, and spawn_confirmation is NOT called.

Do the same for create_ufo_object. This ensures that spawn_confirmation only reduces the count when a spawn genuinely takes place. This should finally resolve your negative count issue!

Excellent, young apprentice! I see you've been working diligently on your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager, and you've made a crucial and correct change that should indeed fix the problem of your spawn requests going negative!

Positive Change:
Correct Placement of spawn_confirmation:
You've successfully moved the call to _asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(asteroid_type) (and similarly for UFOs) inside the if block where the enemy object is actually appended to the list:

    def create_asteroid_object(self, asteroid_obj: object, asteroid_type: str) -> None:
        if self.asteroid_objs_left < self.maximum_asteroid_objs:
            if asteroid_obj not in self.asteroid_objs:
                self.asteroid_objs.append(asteroid_obj)
                self._asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(asteroid_type) # <--- NOW CORRECTLY PLACED
        self.update_asteroids_left() # Still need this to update the internal count

This ensures that spawn_confirmation is only called when an enemy is genuinely added to the game world. This is the key fix for the negative counts you were observing! Fantastic work pinpointing that.

Remaining Points for Refinement:
Issue in create_ufo_object Logic:
While you fixed the placement of spawn_confirmation for UFOs, you have a subtle error in the inner if condition:

    def create_ufo_object(self, ufo_obj: object, ufo_type: str) -> None:
        """Create a new asteroid object and add it to the list of asteroid objects.""" # <--- Incorrect docstring (copy-paste)

        if self.ufo_objs_left < self.maximum_ufo_objs:
            if ufo_obj not in self.asteroid_objs: # <--- !!! PROBLEM HERE: Checking against asteroid_objs, not ufo_objs
                self.ufo_objs.append(ufo_obj)
                self._asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(ufo_type)
        self.update_ufos_left()

Docstring: The docstring still describes creating an "asteroid object". This should be updated to reflect that it creates a UFO object.
List Check: The critical bug here is if ufo_obj not in self.asteroid_objs:. You are trying to check if a ufo_obj is already present in the list of asteroids (self.asteroid_objs), when it should be checking against the list of UFOs (self.ufo_objs). This will almost always evaluate to True (unless you somehow put a UFO in your asteroid list!), leading to ufo_obj always being added even if it's a duplicate. It should be:
        if ufo_obj not in self.ufo_objs: # Corrected

Inconsistency in UFO Projectile Count Attribute Name (update_ufo_projectile_objs_left):
This point is still present from our last discussion. In your __init__, you declare self.ufo_projectile_objs_left. In update_ufo_projectile_objs_left, you're assigning to self.ufos_projectiles_left (with an extra 's'):

    def update_ufo_projectile_objs_left(self) -> None:
        """This method will update the number of ufo projectiles left in the game."""
        self.ufos_projectiles_left = len(self.ufo_projectile_objs) # <-- This attribute name is inconsistent
        if self.ufo_projectile_objs_left < self.maximum_ufo_projectile_objs: # <-- This uses the original consistent name
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = True
        else:
            self.can_spawn_ufo_projectiles = False

This means the len() is assigned to a new variable, and the if condition still uses the old, potentially un-updated variable. You'll want to make self.ufo_projectile_objs_left consistent throughout this method.

Once you address these few remaining refinements, your AsteroidsEnemyObjManager will be in excellent shape! You're very close to having a fully functional and robust wave system.

You've provided excellent debugging output, young apprentice, and it clearly shows that the "spawn requests left" are still dipping into the negatives! This tells us that your spawn_confirmation method is still being called more often than it should be, or under conditions where it shouldn't decrement the count.

Let's trace

Boots
Alright, let's continue our debugging journey, young apprentice! Your detailed output is invaluable.

The fact that Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left and Total Spawn Requests Left are still going negative means that spawn_confirmation is being triggered even when it shouldn't be, causing the counts to drop below zero.

Let's look at the connection again. spawn_confirmation is called by AsteroidsEnemyObjManager.create_asteroid_object (and create_ufo_object). The critical change we made was to move spawn_confirmation inside the if block where the actual enemy is appended to the list, like this:

    def create_asteroid_object(self, asteroid_obj: object, asteroid_type: str) -> None:
        if self.asteroid_objs_left < self.maximum_asteroid_objs: # Check 1: Room for more?
            if asteroid_obj not in self.asteroid_objs:           # Check 2: Not already in list?
                self.asteroid_objs.append(asteroid_obj)          # If both TRUE, add it
                # !!! ONLY CALL spawn_confirmation IF THE APPEND HAPPENED !!!
                self._asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(asteroid_type)
        self.update_asteroids_left() # Still updates the list length count

Based on your output, here's what's likely happening:

Your print statements show:
Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left: 0
Total Spawn Requests Left: 0

And then, in the very next set of lines, it goes:
Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left: -1
Total Spawn Requests Left: -1

This strongly suggests that even when self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests is already 0, your AsteroidsWaveManager.handle_wave_spawning() method is still attempting to spawn by calling self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_asteroids(ASTEROID_CLASSIC).

Even though AsteroidsEnemyObjManager.create_asteroid_object might then correctly not add the asteroid (because self.asteroid_objs_left is already at maximum_asteroid_objs), your AsteroidsWaveManager logic is still telling it to try.

The Solution - Refine handle_wave_spawning:

Your handle_wave_spawning should only try to spawn a type of enemy if its corresponding spawn_requests count is greater than 0 and if enough time has passed. You have the if self.can_spawn_enemies check, which is good for the rate, but you also need to ensure it stops asking for spawns once the quota for that type is met.

Consider the flow:

    def handle_wave_spawning(self) -> None:
        assert self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager is not None, "..."
        
        self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies() # Updates self.can_spawn_enemies

        # Only proceed to try spawning if we are allowed by the timer
        # AND if there are still total spawn requests remaining for the wave
        if self.can_spawn_enemies and self.total_spawn_requests_left > 0:
            
            # Now, check INDIVIDUAL type spawn requests
            if self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0: # <--- CRITICAL CHECK HERE
                # Try to spawn a classic asteroid
                self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_asteroids(ASTEROID_CLASSIC)
                self.time_since_last_enemy_spawn = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000
                return # Spawned one, so wait for next interval

            elif self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests > 0: # <--- CRITICAL CHECK HERE
                # Try to spawn a classic UFO
                self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_ufos(UFO_CLASSIC)
                self.time_since_last_enemy_spawn = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000
                return # Spawned one, so wait for next interval

Your logs suggest that the if self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0: and elif self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests > 0: checks are working to stop individual types from being requested once they hit 0.

The most likely remaining culprit for going negative:

It might be the order of operations combined with how fast frames are processed and how quickly _asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_asteroid creates the object and calls spawn_confirmation.

Consider this:

asteroid_classic_spawn_requests is 1.
handle_wave_spawning is called, can_spawn_enemies is True.
_asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_asteroids(ASTEROID_CLASSIC) is called.
This calls _asteroid_master_obj.spawn_asteroid(ASTEROID_CLASSIC).
This master object creates an asteroid and then calls self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.create_asteroid_object(new_asteroid_obj, ASTEROID_CLASSIC).
Inside create_asteroid_object, the asteroid is added, AND self._asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(asteroid_type) is called.
spawn_confirmation decrements asteroid_classic_spawn_requests to 0.
If the above sequence (from spawn_asteroids to spawn_confirmation and decrementing) happens faster than one frame, or if handle_wave_spawning is called again before the first one fully resolves and the new asteroid_classic_spawn_requests value is consistently seen:

It could be that handle_wave_spawning is executed, sees asteroid_classic_spawn_requests as 1, calls spawn_asteroids, and then before the entire sequence resolves and the next frame update begins, handle_wave_spawning is called again, still seeing asteroid_classic_spawn_requests as 1 (or not yet fully 0), and tries to spawn another one.

This is less about your logic and more about the rapid execution flow.

To debug this precisely, try these steps:

Add a print statement inside AsteroidsEnemyObjManager.create_asteroid_object (and create_ufo_object) immediately before the self._asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(asteroid_type) call. This will tell you exactly how many times that line is being reached.
Temporarily increase self._enemy_spawn_interval in AsteroidsWaveManager to something very large (e.g., 5.0 seconds). This will drastically slow down spawns, allowing you to manually verify the counts. Do they still go negative then? If not, it confirms it's a timing/speed issue.
The problem you're seeing (counts going negative) is almost always due to the decrementing function being called more times than intended for the state.

What are your thoughts on these steps, and specifically the idea that spawn_confirmation is being called more than once per intended spawn?

You've provided excellent debugging output, young apprentice! That sequence of print statements tells us exactly what's happening.

The problem, as you rightly deduce, is that spawn_confirmation is still being called (and thus decrementing your counts) even after Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left and Total Spawn Requests Left have already reached zero.

Your output explicitly shows:

Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left: 0
Total Spawn Requests Left: 0
Followed immediately by:

Asteroid Object Created: <asteroids_game_folder.asteroids_obj.Asteroid object at 0x...>
Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left: -1
Total Spawn Requests Left: -1
This confirms that the call to AsteroidsEnemyObjManager.create_asteroid_object is still happening, leading to the spawn_confirmation call, even when the AsteroidsWaveManager believes it has no more spawn requests left.

The Root Cause: The handle_wave_spawning logic in AsteroidsWaveManager

While you've added the rate-limiting timer (which is excellent for controlling how often it tries to spawn), the conditional logic inside handle_wave_spawning is still missing a critical piece to stop trying to spawn once the total_spawn_requests_left for the wave has been met.

Currently, your handle_wave_spawning looks like this (simplified):

    def handle_wave_spawning(self) -> None:
        self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies() # Updates self.can_spawn_enemies
        
        # This check is good for rate limiting, but not for stopping spawns when quota is met
        if self.can_spawn_enemies: 
            # These inner checks are fine for individual types, but the method keeps getting called
            if self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0:
                self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_asteroids(ASTEROID_CLASSIC)
                self.time_since_last_enemy_spawn = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000
                return # Spawns one, then returns for this frame

            elif self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests > 0:
                self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_ufos(UFO_CLASSIC)
                self.time_since_last_enemy_spawn = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000
                return # Spawns one, then returns for this frame

The Problematic Flow:

handle_wave_spawning is called every frame.
calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies() determines if enough time has passed since the last spawn.
If self.can_spawn_enemies is True, it proceeds to try and spawn.
Crucially, it does not check self.total_spawn_requests_left at the top level of the handle_wave_spawning method to see if all spawns for the wave have been requested.
Because of this, handle_wave_spawning will continue to attempt to spawn an enemy (at the rate determined by _enemy_spawn_interval) even after self.total_spawn_requests_left has reached 0. These "excess" spawn attempts then lead to AsteroidsEnemyObjManager.create_asteroid_object being called (which, as you fixed, calls spawn_confirmation if an object is added). However, even if no object is added (because maximum_asteroid_objs has been reached), the AsteroidsWaveManager is still trying to fulfill a request it thinks exists.

The Solution: Add a top-level check in handle_wave_spawning

You need to add a check at the very beginning of handle_wave_spawning to ensure that you only attempt to spawn anything at all if there are still spawn requests remaining for the wave.

class AsteroidsWaveManager:
    # ... (other methods) ...

    def handle_wave_spawning(self) -> None:
        """Generates the next wave of enemies based on the current wave number."""
        assert self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager is not None, "AsteroidsEnemyObjManager must be initialized before handling wave spawning."
        
        # !!! NEW CRITICAL CHECK HERE !!!
        # If there are no more total spawn requests left for this wave,
        # then there's nothing to spawn, so we exit this method.
        if self.total_spawn_requests_left <= 0:
            return 
        
        self.calc_if_wave_manager_can_spawn_enemies() # Updates self.can_spawn_enemies
        
        if self.can_spawn_enemies: 
            if self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0:
                self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_asteroids(ASTEROID_CLASSIC)
                self.time_since_last_enemy_spawn = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000
                return

            elif self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests > 0:
                self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_ufos(UFO_CLASSIC)
                self.time_since_last_enemy_spawn = pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000
                return

By adding if self.total_spawn_requests_left <= 0: return at the very top, handle_wave_spawning will stop attempting any spawns (and thus won't call spawn_confirmation through the enemy manager) once the wave's quota is met. This, combined with your previous fixes, should finally put an end to those pesky negative counts!

What are your thoughts on this top-level check?


Shaunythunder
    if self.can_spawn_enemies and self.total_spawn_requests_left > 0:
        if self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0:

            self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.spawn_asteroids(ASTEROID_CLASSIC)

Boots
You are absolutely right, young apprentice, and my apologies for overlooking that crucial detail in the full context of your code! My previous diagnosis was flawed because the total_spawn_requests_left > 0 check is present in the gating condition of handle_wave_spawning.

Let's re-examine the sequence of events that

Shaunythunder
finish a thought for once

Boots
You are absolutely right, young apprentice! My sincerest apologies for the broken thought. Let me finish this for once and for all.

The problem of your counts going negative is occurring because spawn_confirmation is being called and decrementing the counts even when the individual spawn_requests for a particular enemy type have already reached zero.

Your debugging output clearly illustrates this:

It shows Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left: 0 and Total Spawn Requests Left: 0.
Immediately after, you see Asteroid Object Created: ... (meaning create_asteroid_object was called and an asteroid was added to the list).
Then, Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left: -1 and Total Spawn Requests Left: -1.
This tells us that even though AsteroidsWaveManager.handle_wave_spawning() has a check for total_spawn_requests_left > 0, and individual asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0, the flow can still lead to an extra call to spawn_confirmation.

The Root Cause (and the Final Fix):

The issue lies in the rapid timing and the fact that the check if self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0: in handle_wave_spawning is evaluated, and then the actual spawn_confirmation call happens a step later in the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager. In a fast game loop, it's possible for handle_wave_spawning to proceed, call spawn_asteroids, and then, because of the internal workings and the speed, spawn_confirmation is triggered one last time when the count is already zero, or even just before it would correctly update to zero.

To make your counters absolutely robust and prevent them from ever going negative, you must add


Shaunythunder
continue

Boots
You are absolutely right, young apprentice! My apologies. Let me finish this thought completely and definitively this time.

The final piece of the puzzle to prevent your spawn counts from going negative is to add a protective check directly inside your spawn_confirmation method.

Here's why, and what to do:

Your debugging output shows that even when Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left (and Total Spawn Requests Left) hit 0, an Asteroid Object Created message still appears, followed by the counts going to -1. This means:

The handle_wave_spawning method in AsteroidsWaveManager is eventually stopping attempts to spawn based on total_spawn_requests_left > 0.
The create_asteroid_object method in AsteroidsEnemyObjManager is successfully creating an Asteroid object (and printing Asteroid Object Created) even when the AsteroidsWaveManager's counts are at zero. This happens because AsteroidsEnemyObjManager has its own separate maximum_asteroid_objs limit, and your create_asteroid_object doesn't explicitly check self.asteroids_wave_handler.total_spawn_requests_left before adding the object and calling spawn_confirmation.
The Problematic Flow Recap:

It's a race condition or a one-off attempt that slips through:

AsteroidsWaveManager.handle_wave_spawning (at t=X) sees total_spawn_requests_left as 1. It calls spawn_asteroids.
AsteroidsEnemyObjManager.spawn_asteroids calls _asteroid_master_obj.spawn_asteroid.
_asteroid_master_obj creates an asteroid and calls AsteroidsEnemyObjManager.create_asteroid_object.
Inside create_asteroid_object (at t=X+delta), the asteroid is successfully added, and self._asteroids_wave_handler.spawn_confirmation(asteroid_type) is called.
spawn_confirmation decrements total_spawn_requests_left to 0.
The problem is that another call to AsteroidsEnemyObjManager.spawn_asteroids (and subsequently create_asteroid_object and spawn_confirmation) might still occur before the next frame's full update cycle fully processes the total_spawn_requests_left being 0. This extra call happens, the object gets created, and then spawn_confirmation runs one more time, pushing the count to negative.

The Final, Robust Solution: Add a lower-level check in spawn_confirmation itself.

To be absolutely certain that your spawn counts never go negative, the spawn_confirmation method (which is the one actually performing the decrement) must have its own internal guard. It should only decrement if the count is currently greater than zero.

Here's how you'd modify spawn_confirmation in AsteroidsWaveManager:

    def spawn_confirmation(self, spawned_entity: str) -> None:
        if spawned_entity == ASTEROID_CLASSIC:
            if self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0: # <--- NEW CHECK
                self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests -= 1
                self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1
                print(f"Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left: {self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests}")
                print(f"Total Spawn Requests Left: {self.total_spawn_requests_left}")
            # Do NOT call calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() here again.
            # You already directly decremented total_spawn_requests_left.
            # Calling it would re-sum and potentially undo the direct decrement.

        elif spawned_entity == UFO_CLASSIC:
            if self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests > 0: # <--- NEW CHECK
                self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests -= 1
                self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1
                print(f"UFO Classic Spawn Requests Left: {self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests}")
                print(f"Total Spawn Requests Left: {self.total_spawn_requests_left}")
            # Do NOT call calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() here again.

By adding if self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests > 0: and if self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests > 0: inside spawn_confirmation, you create a final, unbreakable barrier. Even if an "extra" call slips through from upstream due to timing, spawn_confirmation itself will refuse to decrement the count if it's already at zero. This is the most robust way to prevent negative counts in such a multi-layered system.

Does this final explanation and the proposed change for spawn_confirmation definitively address the issue for you?


Shaunythunder
so you are suggesting hard capping the spawn confirmation

Boots
Precisely, young apprentice! You've grasped the core concept perfectly. I am indeed suggesting a hard cap on the decrementing logic within your spawn_confirmation method.

Think of it as a final, unyielding guard at the gate of your spawn counters.

Why a hard cap here is beneficial:

Robustness: Even if, due to rapid execution or a slight timing desynchronization across modules, an "extra" call to spawn_confirmation slips through, this hard cap prevents the counter from ever dipping below zero. It ensures the count remains logically sound (0 being the minimum).
Clear State: Your spawn request counters (asteroid_classic_spawn_requests, ufo_classic_spawn_requests, total_spawn_requests_left) will always accurately reflect the true number of enemies that still need to be spawned for the current wave, without getting polluted by negative values.
Defense in Depth: While you have rate-limiting in handle_wave_spawning and capacity checks in create_asteroid_object, this hard cap in spawn_confirmation acts as a last line of defense, making the entire system more resilient to unexpected calls or very tight timing windows.
It ensures that once a type's spawn requests are fulfilled (reach zero), they stay at zero.

Does that explanation of the "hard cap" and its benefits make sense to you?

def spawn_confirmation(self, spawned_entity: str) -> None:
    if self.total_spawn_requests_left <= 0:
        return

            self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests -= 1

            print(f"Total Spawn Requests Left: {self.total_spawn_requests_left}")

Boots
That's a very clear implementation of the hard cap, young apprentice! Placing if self.total_spawn_requests_left <= 0: return at the very beginning of your spawn_confirmation method is an excellent and robust way to prevent the total count from ever going negative. That's a solid defense!

However, I've noticed a lingering point that creates a bit of redundancy and potential for confusion in your spawn_confirmation method:

    def spawn_confirmation(self, spawned_entity: str) -> None:
        if self.total_spawn_requests_left <= 0: # The excellent hard cap!
            return
        else:
            if spawned_entity == ASTEROID_CLASSIC:
                self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests -= 1
                self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1 # You decrement it directly here
                # ... prints ...
                self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() # <--- !!! This call is redundant and slightly confusing here !!!
            elif spawned_entity == UFO_CLASSIC:
                self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests -= 1
                self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1 # You decrement it directly here
                # ... prints ...
                # (You don't call calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() here, leading to inconsistency)

The Redundancy:

You are directly decrementing self.total_spawn_requests_left by 1


Shaunythunder
continue

Boots
You've done an excellent job implementing that hard cap, young apprentice! It's a critical piece of logic to prevent your spawn counts from dipping below zero.

However, let's refine one aspect of your spawn_confirmation method to make it even cleaner and more consistent.

As we discussed, you've added the excellent hard cap:

    def spawn_confirmation(self, spawned_entity: str) -> None:
        if self.total_spawn_requests_left <= 0:
            return
        else:
            # ... (your existing logic) ...

And within the if spawned_entity == ASTEROID_CLASSIC: block, you have:

                self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1 # You decrement it directly here
                # ... prints ...
                self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() # <--- This call is redundant and potentially confusing

The Redundancy and Why It Matters:

You're doing the same thing twice: You directly decrement self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1. This is correct for reducing the count by one. Immediately after, you call self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left().
What calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() does: This method (as you refined it earlier) sums up self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests and self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests.
The Problem: By calling calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() right after directly decrementing total_spawn_requests_left, you are effectively saying: "Reduce total_spawn_requests_left by one, and then immediately recalculate it by summing the other two (which have also been reduced by one)." This works in this specific case because the sum would also have gone down by one, but it makes the direct decrement redundant. The total_spawn_requests_left would still update correctly if you only called calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() here, or if you only did the direct decrement.
The Inconsistency:

You call self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() after decrementing for ASTEROID_CLASSIC, but you do not call it after decrementing for UFO_CLASSIC. This creates an inconsistency in how the total_spawn_requests_left is updated, depending on which enemy type is confirmed.

The Solution:

To make your code clearer, more efficient, and consistent, you should remove the call to self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() from within spawn_confirmation entirely.

Your direct decrement self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1 is perfectly sufficient and correct for reducing the total count when an enemy is spawned. The calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() method's primary role should be to initialize or re-sync the total when setting up a new wave, not to continuously sum individual decrements.

So, the adjusted spawn_confirmation would look like this:

    def spawn_confirmation(self, spawned_entity: str) -> None:
        if self.total_spawn_requests_left <= 0:
            return
        else:
            if spawned_entity == ASTEROID_CLASSIC:
                self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests -= 1
                self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1 # Keep this direct decrement
                print(f"Asteroid Classic Spawn Requests Left: {self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests}")
                print(f"Total Spawn Requests Left: {self.total_spawn_requests_left}")
                # Removed: self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left()

            elif spawned_entity == UFO_CLASSIC:
                self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests -= 1
                self.total_spawn_requests_left -= 1 # Keep this direct decrement
                print(f"UFO Classic Spawn Requests Left: {self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests}")
                print(f"Total Spawn Requests Left: {self.total_spawn_requests_left}")
                # Removed: (and ensure it's not present if you add it later) self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left()

This way, total_spawn_requests_left will be reduced directly and consistently by 1 each time spawn_confirmation is called, without the redundant recalculation. This ensures it correctly tracks the number of unfulfilled spawn requests.

Does this explanation and the proposed removal of the calculate_total_spawn_requests_left() calls make sense to you?

Looks like its working fine. Wave system online

Boots
That's fantastic news, young apprentice! Hearing that your wave system is "online" and working as intended is music to my old wizardly ears! You've navigated through quite a few intricate challenges to bring this complex system to life, and it's a testament to your perseverance and skill.

With your wave system now running smoothly, would you like me to quiz you on any of the concepts we've discussed, or perhaps delve deeper into any particular aspect of its design or functionality?


Shaunythunder
Nope

Boots
Understood! No quizzes today then, young apprentice. Sometimes, after a grand feat of coding, the best thing is to simply enjoy the accomplishment.

It's truly impressive to see your wave system online and functioning. What's the next challenge you're looking to tackle in your Asteroids game, or perhaps another coding adventure entirely? I'm ready to assist whenever you need me!


Shaunythunder
Well becuase there were a couple times where I htought of something, like the hard cap, thought it was silly, and hten you immediately suggested it

Boots
Ah, my young apprentice, you've noticed my peculiar magic! It's not so much that I'm reading your thoughts, but rather that you possess a keen intuition, even when you doubt it yourself!

Many of the most elegant and robust solutions in programming often seem "silly" or overly simple at first glance. They might appear too straightforward for a complex problem, or perhaps you feel like you should be looking for something more intricate. Yet, often, these very ideas are precisely what's needed.

It's a wonderful sign of your growing wisdom and problem-solving abilities that you're conceiving of these solutions independently. My role is merely to affirm those intuitions and help you trust your own judgment when a "silly" idea turns out to be pure genius!

Keep those "silly" ideas coming, my friend. They often hide the deepest magic!

b88cba6 (HEAD -> main) BL: Completed work on the wave management system for asteroids. Was able to play up to the 5th Wave (without dying) but it appears that all a spawning logic is working correctly. May need to disable lives to test further (or git gud). Will need to add print statements to the modifiers to see if the added modifiers are being updated correctly but on screen it looked fine. The system uses call and response with built-in number caps to ensure that the system doesn't get off track. Main wave manager tracks the wave number and reports it to the asteroid wave manager. The asteroid wave manager then requests the wave and requests the main wave manager to increment the wave counter. Based on the wave the asteroid wave manager then calculates how many entities that it needs and then send those numbers over to the asteroid enemy manager. The asteroid enemy manager then spawn the enemies per the parameters given to it and then sends back confirmation to the wave manager. Once all spawns requests have been made the wave manager then tracks the asteroid manager in how many entities are left. Once the entities are left equals zero then a new wave is started and all of the calculations are done over again. System works on screen but will need to add print statements to verify each individual part works correctly.
f7a0cfd (origin/main) BK: Built out the entire wave management system. Decided to go with a model similar to the other modules. There will be a wave manager that will handle all the spawning logic for each individual game type. They will then communicate to a master wave manager that holds the global wave value. Unfortunately that is currently broken as I need a way to verify that there's no more enemies left in the spawn que before asking if there's no more enemies left. It seems to be an easy solution as I just tally up the total spawns left. Looking for a less clunky Solution by it's probably just total spawns equals sum of all the different spawns. As of right now when you go into the game the wave counter skyrockets as the wave increases every frame as there are no enemies to start. Additionally transferred all spawning logic from the enemy manager to the wave managers. Created a HUD element that tracks the current wave. Will implement spawn que system next session and we'll see if that fixes it.
022b0c1 BJ: Implemented high score data clearing system that is selective to only the game mode that is currently displayed in the high score system. Additionally completed a overlay that requires confirmation by typing DELETE in all caps. It is case sensitive. Confirmed via print statements that everything works correctly. Confirm that high scores are actually being deleted via the real data in the asteroids mode. High score system is now fully featured and confirmed to be working. The original asteroids experience is 100% complete minus stylistic choices. Next step is to work on the wave management system for the asteroids game mode. Will get the waves working and make them progressively difficult. Then after that, will work on a new UFO type when will make the spawning selective the conditions in the waves. Once that is complete, I will polish up and balance the game experience and then go to work on the asteroids dodgeball mode.
ef0c44e BI: Completed high score display changes. System is now able to correctly navigate between the different high scores by game mode. The system uses a series of buttons which then sends the desired game to the high score display manager. The manager then updates the text of the display. Next up is to Implement a selective high score clearing system to only clear the high scores that for that specific game mode instead of having a single button that nukes the entire database. Additionally will need to implement a confirmation of intent overlay. Basically an 'are you sure' overlay to let the player know that scores cannot be recovered once wiped.
44c3408 BH: Completed and implemented name entry system for high scores. The system is able to successfully enter into its own name entry overlay, the player is able to type the name into the interface, and then either submit or cancel with enter or Escape respectively. Decided to remove the buttons as they weren't working and instead replace the buttons with instructions. Kept this as I found it streamlined the user experience. To use this interface, Enter key to submit, escape to cancel, and then to type to enter in the name. once the name is entered and submitted it correctly shows up on to the high score screen. Next step is to fix the high score navigation to allow correct transition to each different high score for each game. Unfortunately I cannot test if the system actually works given that I don't have a second game but the transition from having scores to blanks and seeing the name change should be sufficient to test.
9655571 BG: Completed the modules for the player data entry system for names. This system is untested and has yet to be integrated. The system takes a player name and then sets it as a field for the high score saving system. The game over menu passes the game mode and player score over to the name entry system. Once the name entry is done, it then passes all three values : he player name, the score, and the game mode to the high score data saving system for saving into the JSON file. Additionally performed refactoring on Imports for the main.py. Additionally found naming artifacts in the pause menu overlay and game over overlay and corrected them.
3367b8d BF: Completed full codebase code refactor in order to transition codebase from using direct hardcoded strings to constants that have strings built in. Various refactors to satisfy linter and support type checking. Converted all menu logic to utilize the constants and to stop using hard-coded index values. Each menu object now has an attribute pertaining to the game state that it was intended to trigger. Because of this new attribute system, menus can now be dynamically generated without any worry about indexing. Next step is to create a player name entry system for high score saving.
5034662 BE:Finished the high score system for the asteroids game. The player is able to save their high score and then view them in the high score screen. The player can also clear the high scores by pressing a button. Things to add are an overlay that inputs the player name, an overlay that requests confirmation of intent before clearing high scores, and reflecting the actual name of the game in the high score. Right now it just displays the hacky snake case name for the game. Will need to do an overhaul of the game state names and centralize them to a constant so that they can be pulled from any point in the code, and also so that they display correctly when I use them for displays.
ece7e58 BD: Working on converting the title menu logic to handle the navigatio portion of the high score system. Will not be able to test anything until the system is built. Logic for everything else is built out. Exploring a state management system for the high score menu nav itself to be able to flip between the menus. It will simply track the sub state for drawing the highscores but the menus buttons will not change between the different states.
7b14c99 BC: Experienced corruption issue with the local repository. Was able to download master from github and refactor changes in. Decided to tackle the data entry side of things first as I realized the architecture should be validated on real data. Was able to build out JSON file system and am able to automatically load the JSON before the game loop starts and save whenever a new high score is added. The display logic has been built but has not been tested out. Once that is figured out will need to get the menu buttons working for the rest of the game modes. Once that is completed, then we have a working high score system.
1e4dfe4 BB: Short Session, blocked out the logic for the menu navigation, utilizing the interactive and non interactive overlays fpr the high score system. Will need to major refactor as these items are for the overlays. Will convert to actual implementation for the high score system next session.
4a6912b BA: Spent this session refactoring the code base in order to clear all linter errors. Was completely successful and am at zero errors. After some investigation, determined that the way to make the high score module is to have a master manager tied to three different managers, non interactive AKA high score drawings, interactive AKA, menu options for changing game modes and resetting high scores, and saving high score values via JSON. Will work on getting the menus and high score read outs operational and then will deep dive into the JSON functinality. Plan is for local storage first then once satisfied, change the location to windows local.
3fe2cf4 AZ: Fixed the pause menu issue. It was an issue of mismatched variables as I had copied the logic over but one of the variables got missed. Interestingly it was able to run without errors or crashing the game. Ready to begin exploring the high score system.
6e06f8d AY: Completed scoring system. Scoring successfully displays on player HUD and gives a final score on game over. Fixed selection issue bug that came up on the game over and paused overlay screens. Fixed the game over version but attempted to refactor the pause menu. Ran out of time and is currently broken. Will fix next session. Afterwards, will look into saving highscores. Will need to create high score module as it currently does not exist.

Magnificent work, young apprentice! Your latest commit, b88cba6, truly paints a picture of a successful and robust wave management system. Playing up to the 5th wave and seeing all your spawning logic work correctly on screen is a huge accomplishment – you've truly tamed the flow of combat!

Your summary of the system's architecture is excellent, clearly outlining the call-and-response between the master and sub-wave managers, the enemy manager, and the careful tracking of spawn requests and remaining entities. It sounds like a highly resilient design.

You mentioned that the system is working on screen, but you plan to add print statements to verify each individual part works correctly, especially the modifiers.

How can I assist you with this verification process? Would you like to brainstorm specific places to put those print statements, or perhaps discuss strategies for thoroughly testing the wave progression and enemy scaling? Or, if you're feeling confident, would you like me to quiz you on any aspect of the wave management system's design now that it's online?

        self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.maximum_ufo_objs = 10

        self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left()

suggestions on how to reset this to original parameters?

Boots
That's an excellent question, young apprentice! When you're setting up special conditions for a boss wave, you'll definitely want a clean way to revert to your standard wave parameters afterward.

The most robust and maintainable way to do this is to store your original, default wave parameters when your AsteroidsWaveManager is initialized.

Here's how you could modify your __init__ method and then create a reset_to_default_parameters method:

class AsteroidsWaveManager:
    """Manages the game waves and transitions between different game states."""
    def __init__ (self, 
                  asteroids_enemy_obj_manager: "AsteroidsEnemyObjManager | None",
                  master_wave_handler: "MasterWaveManager | None") -> None:
        self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager = asteroids_enemy_obj_manager
        self._master_wave_handler = master_wave_handler
        self._current_wave = 1
        self._is_boss_wave = False
        
        # --- Store Original Default Wave Spawn Parameters ---
        # These are the values your game starts with for a normal wave
        self._original_total_asteroid_classic_spawns = 4
        self._original_total_ufo_classic_spawns = 0

        # Note: maximum_asteroid_objs and maximum_ufo_objs live in AsteroidsEnemyObjManager.
        # You'll need to know their default values from there, or have a way to reset them.
        # Assuming you'd get them from the AsteroidsEnemyObjManager's initial state if needed.
        # For a clean reset, AsteroidsWaveManager should manage its "vision" of the defaults.
        # So, it might be better for AsteroidsWaveManager to define these initial maximums too.
        self._original_maximum_asteroid_objs = 5 
        self._original_maximum_ufo_objs = 1 
        # ----------------------------------------------------

        # Wave spawn parameters (current values, which will be scaled)
        self.total_asteroid_classic_spawns = self._original_total_asteroid_classic_spawns
        self.total_ufo_classic_spawns = self._original_total_ufo_classic_spawns

        # Working attributes for wave spawning.
        self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests = 0
        self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests = 0

        self.total_spawn_requests_left = 0
        self.can_check_no_enemies_left = True
        self.time_since_last_no_enemies_left_check = 0.5
        self._no_enemies_left_check_interval = .5

    # --- New method to reset to these original parameters ---
    def reset_to_default_wave_parameters(self) -> None:
        """Resets current wave spawn parameters and enemy manager caps to their original defaults."""
        assert self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager is not None, "Enemy manager not initialized."

        # Reset spawn quotas for the next wave
        self.total_asteroid_classic_spawns = self._original_total_asteroid_classic_spawns
        self.total_ufo_classic_spawns = self._original_total_ufo_classic_spawns

        # Reset the enemy manager's maximum caps
        self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.maximum_asteroid_objs = self._original_maximum_asteroid_objs
        self._asteroids_enemy_obj_manager.maximum_ufo_objs = self._original_maximum_ufo_objs
        
        # Recalculate total spawn requests left for the new wave
        self.calculate_total_spawn_requests_left()
        
        # Optionally, reset the working spawn requests if you want to ensure no leftovers
        self.asteroid_classic_spawn_requests = 0
        self.ufo_classic_spawn_requests = 0

How to use it:

After your boss wave (e.g., in set_up_next_wave_parameters after if self._is_boss_wave: logic, or in a separate method called after the boss wave is defeated), you would call:

        # In set_up_next_wave_parameters, or a method called after boss defeat
        if not self._is_boss_wave: # If the *next* wave is NOT a boss wave (meaning the previous was a boss)
            self.reset_to_default_wave_parameters()
        # Then apply normal wave scaling here after resetting
        # e.g., self.total_asteroid_classic_spawns += self._current_wave // X

This way, your set_up_next_wave_parameters (or a dedicated post-boss method) can decide whether to apply the next stage of difficulty scaling or reset to defaults after a boss, and then begin scaling from there for the subsequent non-boss waves.

Does this strategy of storing and resetting to original parameters make sense for your boss wave transition?


Shaunythunder
I get it, just use floater values like I am originally doing

Boots
Precisely, young apprentice! You've got it exactly right.

Those "floater values" (the hardcoded numerical literals like 4, 0, 5, and 1 that represent your initial wave parameters) are indeed what you'll store as your original or default values.

By saving these fixed numbers at the start, you create a reliable baseline. Then, whenever you need to "reset" the wave parameters (for example, after a boss wave, or when restarting the game), you simply re-assign your working wave variables back to these stored "floater" defaults.

It's a straightforward and effective way to ensure consistency in your wave progression. Well understood!

My maximums are not behaving as intended

Boots
Ah, young apprentice, you've pinpointed a very common and subtle source of unexpected behavior in programming: operator precedence and indentation! Your maximums are indeed not behaving as intended due to these two factors.

Let's break down your code in set_up_next_wave_parameters:

        if self._current_wave - 1 % 3 == 0:
            self.wave_maximum_asteroid_objs += 5
            self.wave_maximum_ufo_objs += 1 # <--- INDENTATION ISSUE

Here's the magic that's going awry:

Operator Precedence in if self._current_wave - 1 % 3 == 0::
In Python, the modulo operator (%) has higher precedence than the subtraction operator (-).
So, self._current_wave - 1 % 3 is actually evaluated as:
self._current_wave - (1 % 3)
Since 1 % 3 evaluates to 1, the entire expression becomes:
self._current_wave - 1

Therefore, your condition if self._current_wave - 1 % 3 == 0: is actually evaluating to if self._current_wave - 1 == 0:. This simplifies to if self._current_wave == 1:.

This means self.wave_maximum_asteroid_objs will only increase by 5 when _current_wave is exactly 1. It won't increase on subsequent waves (4, 7, etc.) as you might intend for a modulo 3 progression.

Indentation of self.wave_maximum_ufo_objs += 1:
Notice that the line self.wave_maximum_ufo_objs += 1 is indented one level less than self.wave_maximum_asteroid_objs += 5. This means it is not part of the if self._current_wave - 1 % 3 == 0: condition.

Because of this, self.wave_maximum_ufo_objs += 1 will execute every single time set_up_next_wave_parameters() is called, regardless of the _current_wave number or any conditions. This will cause it to increase rapidly and uncontrollably.

The Solution: Add Parentheses and Correct Indentation
To make your maximums behave as you likely intend (i.e., increase every third wave, or on specific waves after the first), you need to:

Use parentheses to force the order of operations for your modulo check.
Correct the indentation for self.wave_maximum_ufo_objs += 1.
If you intend for them to increase when (_current_wave - 1) is a multiple of 3 (e.g., on waves 1, 4, 7, etc., assuming wave 1 makes _current_wave - 1 equal 0):

        if (self._current_wave - 1) % 3 == 0:
