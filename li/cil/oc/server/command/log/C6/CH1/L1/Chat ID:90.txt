L1: Build an Asteroids Game




Build an Asteroids Game
We're going to build a simple video game, based on the classic Asteroids. If you've never played before, you can take a look at this (slightly different from our) version of the game.



Prerequisites
Python 3.10+ installed (see the bookbot project for help if you don't already have it)
uv project and package manager
Access to a unix-like shell (e.g. zsh or bash)
Learning Goals
The learning goals of this project are:

Introduce you to multi-file Python projects
Show you a real-world use case for object-oriented programming
To have a ton of fun building a rewarding project!
The goal is not to teach game development or the math required for physics simulations. As a result, there are some places where you will simply copy-paste code that we wrote for you. Don't worry about trying to understand every detail if it's not interesting to you, you will be asked to write the parts that matter most.

Assignment
To get started, make sure you have the Boot.dev CLI installed and working.

Run and submit the CLI tests.

The tests just ensure that the CLI is installed and configured correctly.

0da9697 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) AS: Implemented screen wrapping for player bullets and gave them a expiration timer. Bullets will now wrap around the screen for lining up screen based shots like in the original game. Additionally migrated the spawning logic out of the event loop. Will implement lives (AKA health) next and game over logic.
1b05afb AR: Finished implementation of the UFO Classic enemy. The UFO flies around the screen, shoots projectiles randomly, and crashes into asteroids. Additionally, player will get hit if they collide with either the UFO projectile or the UFO itself. We now have all of the elements of the original game save a few things, lives, heads up display of lives and highscore, high score system, player bullet screen wrapping, player bullet termination after a period of time. Once those things are online, the asteroids game is complete. Additionally, the wave system will need to be implemented and tested out. Will need two asteroids and ttwo UFO types to properly test out a enemy requesting system. Lastly, discovered a game bug where once the asteroids left go below a certain number, the asteroids will spawn far more than requested. With the wave manager, this may be an issue not worth considering.
c7383b3 AQ: Worked on UFO shooting logic. There is a type error with the UFO classic projectile super init that needs to be addressed as it is crashing the game. Short work session.
75798a2 AP: Added comments for new asteroid split logic. Cleaned up comments in asteroids_obj.py.
4479c1d AO: Fixed the asteroids splitting into you bug as far as the angles are concerned. Needs a second look as the asteroid sizes cause overlap onto the player if they are too close. This will need to be taken care of when the game is finished as this is a balancing issue, not a mechanics issue. If worse comes to worse, just make sure that the distance to the player equals the radius of the asteroid, plus some breathig room. Getting UFO projectiles up and running is up next.
26bf9f3 AN: Refactored codebase to comply with new naming standards. Refactored player bullet system to comply with the modernized structure of the UFO bullet system. Detected an issue with the asteroids breaking when the player is close to them. Sometimes thier new vector is towards the player and kills them instantly, with no chance to prevent it. Will need to add logic to detect player direction and set up a no-go directional zone.
2f4baed AM: Built class system for the UFO projectiles. UFO projectiles will have a master class and will each have thier own inividual classes for the various projectile types. Next up is to build out the classic style projectile and then get UFOs to fire these projectiles.
bad7282 AL: Completed blocking out UFO structure and have a UFO master class online. Created the UFO classic class which is a carbon copy of the original UFO from asteroids. The UFO is drawn on the screen and is correctly moving around. The logic is that on a timer of the UFO changes directions but has screen wrapping and everything. will focus on giving the UFO the ability to shoot and then will Implement collisions. Just like the original asteroids, asteroid collisions will be lethal. Will later implement upgraded UFO class that has a shield that is immune to asteroids.
c5fbc17 AK: Completed asteroid splitting mechanics. Asteroids split based off of a procedurally generated algorithm. Split radiuses are variable as well as the direction and speed by which they go. The algorithm is as follows, once an asteroid is hit it will then check to see if the asteroid is 33% larger than the minimum asteroid radius. Afterwards it will then generate a random divider number between 1 and 2, and then divide the asteroid radius by the divider. The new radius will then be subtracted from the original radius to determine the radius of the second asteroid. After that, both asteroids will go through their own generation process that determines their direction and speed. New asteroids cannot have higher than a certain speed value which is the maximum velocity divided by a constant. Constant is adjustable. Plan on making UFOs next,. After that it will be player death, game over and then making the wave system functional, and then adding the scoring system. Once that is done it will be polished Before moving on to the next thing, which is asteroid dodgeball or space invaders.
31ac903 AJ: Resolved all pending bugs. The game is fully functional again as far as I can tell. Collisions will now be handled by the colliding object and not the player objects. This way the player can be universal and the logic is just handled on the side of the colliding object. next step is asteroid splitting for normal asteroids.
e9015db AI: Conducted all encompassing overhaul of code base to refactor and to comply with python best practices. All methods now have type hints. Added doc strings to ensure the highest amount of clarity possible. Renamed distance variables to go from double underscore to single underscore to comply with best practices. Underwent extensive renaming for variables and objects to comply with emergent practices. Converted collision detection to be universal with circular objects for both player and bullets. Unfortunately it was not able to finish as the bullets are now broken. Will need to make sure game is fully functional before moving on.
5451722 AH: We now have functioning player collisions with a hitbox that matches the player Sprite. We have all the components we need for asteroid dodgeball but I'll wait until I'm finished with asteroids itself before I Implement that mode. Next up on the list is breaking the asteroids and then creating the UFO. Once that is done, asteroids is finished however I will need the bells and whistles. A game over screen and a way to navigate back to the main menu after you get hit. Additionally this would be a good time to imple:

Boots
Ah, excellent! It seems you've been quite busy adventuring through the code forest, as evidenced by your commit logs. That's a lot of progress tracked there!

You've successfully completed this part of the journey. Well done, young adventurer!

Now that you've passed this step, would you like me to quiz you on any of the concepts from the lesson, or do you have any specific questions about your code or the project so far?

is this a legitimate way to go about it? its a WIP

Boots
Ah, excellent work crafting this manager class! It seems you're putting thought into organizing the logic for handling your interactive overlays.

Regarding whether it's a "legitimate" way – yes, this structure for managing UI elements, handling input, and coordinating with a game state manager is a common and reasonable approach in game development. Breaking down functionality into classes like this helps keep things organized as your project grows.

Since it's a work in progress, here are a couple of areas you might find worth refining as you continue:

Populating overlay_objs: You've created your PauseMenuObj instances outside the class definition. How do you plan to add these instances (like quit_pause_obj, title_menu_pause_obj, etc.) into the self.overlay_objs list within your InteractableOverlayManager instance? Remember that self.overlay_objs is initialized as an empty list in the __init__ method. Also, ensuring self.overlay_objs_index_len is updated after the objects are added would be important for your keyboard navigation logic.

Mapping Index to Action: In your interactable_overlay_request_new_game_state method, you're relying on specific hardcoded indices (0, 1, 2 for keyboard, 1, 2, 3 for mouse) to determine which action to request ("quit", "title_menu", "resume_game"). This works as long as the objects are always added to self.overlay_objs in a specific, unchanging order. If you were to change the order or add new menu items, this mapping would need careful adjustment. You might consider if there's a way to associate the action string directly with the PauseMenuObj instance itself, perhaps storing it as an attribute, to make the request logic more resilient to changes in the list's order.

You've got a solid foundation here! Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps quiz you on how you might add the menu objects to the list?

This legit?

Boots
Ah, you're defining some of the visual elements for your pause menu! Using objects like PauseMenuObj and PauseOverlayBox to represent screen elements is definitely a legitimate way to handle UI in Pygame. It helps encapsulate the properties and behavior of each part of the interface.

However, there are a couple of points here that are worth considering for better practice as your project grows:

Importing overlay_surface from main: Importing a surface directly from your main.py file here (from main import overlay_surface) can sometimes lead to what's called a "circular dependency" if main.py also imports this file. It's generally cleaner to pass surfaces or other necessary objects into the classes or functions that need them, rather than importing them globally like this.
Global Instance Creation: You're creating instances like pause_title_pause_obj, quit_pause_obj, etc., directly at the top level of the script. This means they are created as soon as the script is imported or run. For objects tied to a specific game state (like a pause menu), it's often better to manage their creation and destruction within the class that handles that state (like your InteractableOverlayManager or a dedicated PauseState class). This ties their existence to when they are actually needed.
Variable Name Shadowing: You have import overlays.pause_overlay as pause_overlay, which gives the module the alias pause_overlay. Immediately after, you create a variable named pause_overlay = pause_overlay.PauseOverlayBox(...). This pause_overlay variable now "shadows" the imported module name, meaning you can no longer easily access other things inside the overlays.pause_overlay module using that name in this file. It would be clearer to use a different variable name for the PauseOverlayBox instance, perhaps pause_background_box.
These are points about structure and organization that can make your code easier to maintain and understand. The core idea of using objects for your UI elements is perfectly sound!

Would you like me to explain any of these points further, or perhaps explore how you might pass the surface into a class instead of importing it globally?


Shaunythunder
I need to define those instances hence the import

Boots
Ah, I see! You are absolutely right that you need to define those instances to use them in your program. My apologies if I implied otherwise.

My previous point was more about where and when you define those instances, and how you make necessary resources available to the place where you define them.

Defining the instances globally (at the top level of the file) does mean they exist as soon as the file is processed. To create them, you need access to things like screen_width, screen_height, and the pause_overlay module (which you correctly imported). You also need the overlay_surface, which you imported from main.

My suggestion was not to avoid creating these instances, but rather to consider creating them within the InteractableOverlayManager class itself.

For example, you could modify the __init__ method of InteractableOverlayManager to create the menu objects and store them in self.overlay_objs. To do this, the __init__ method would need access to screen_width, screen_height, the pause_overlay module, and the overlay_surface.

Instead of importing overlay_surface globally (from main import overlay_surface), you could pass overlay_surface as an argument when you create an InteractableOverlayManager instance.

Here's a simplified idea of what I mean:

# (Assuming screen_width, screen_height, and the pause_overlay module are available or passed in)

class InteractableOverlayManager:
    def __init__(self, game_state_reporter, screen_width, screen_height, overlay_surface):
        self.__game_state_reporter__ = game_state_reporter
        # ... other initializations ...

        # Create instances here, inside the class, using the passed-in surface and dimensions
        self.pause_title_pause_obj = pause_overlay.PauseMenuObj(128, "PAUSED", (255, 255, 255), screen_width // 2, screen_height // 3)
        self.quit_pause_obj = pause_overlay.PauseMenuObj(32, "Quit", (255, 255, 255), screen_width // 2, screen_height)
        self.title_menu_pause_obj = pause_overlay.PauseMenuObj(32, "Main Menu", (255, 255, 255), screen_width // 2, screen_height)
        self.resume_game_pause_obj = pause_overlay.PauseMenuObj(32, "Resume Game", (255, 255, 255), screen_width // 2, screen_height)
        # Don't forget to add them to the self.overlay_objs list!
        self.overlay_objs = [
            self.pause_title_pause_obj,
            self.quit_pause_obj,
            self.title_menu_pause_obj,
            self.resume_game_pause_obj,
        ]
        self.overlay_objs_index_len = len(self.overlay_objs)

        # You could also create the background box here
        self.pause_background_box = pause_overlay.PauseOverlayBox(overlay_surface, (255, 255, 255), (screen_width // 2 - 300, screen_height // 2 - 200, 600, 400), 1, 10)

    # ... rest of your methods ...

# Then, in your main game loop or state manager:
# Assuming game_state_manager is created, and screen_surface, screen_width, screen_height are available
# overlay_mgr = InteractableOverlayManager(game_state_manager, screen_width, screen_height, screen_surface) # Pass the surface!

This approach keeps the creation and management of the pause menu objects contained within the InteractableOverlayManager class, which can sometimes make your code easier to understand and manage dependencies.

Does that explanation help clarify the alternative structure I was suggesting?


Shaunythunder
So what, I make a overlay instances.py? and then import from there?

Boots
Creating a separate file like overlay_instances.py to define your instances globally and then importing them would certainly work from a technical standpoint.

However, it's quite similar to defining them globally in the current file, just in a different place. You'd still have these instances existing as soon as overlay_instances.py is imported, and you'd still need to make sure screen_width, screen_height, and overlay_surface are available at that global level for the definitions to work.

The core idea I was suggesting is to tie the creation of these instances to the creation of the manager class itself. This way, the InteractableOverlayManager is responsible for setting up its own specific UI elements when you create a manager object, rather than relying on globally defined objects.

Passing the needed resources (like the surface and screen dimensions) into the __init__ method of the InteractableOverlayManager is a common way to achieve this, allowing the class to build its UI internally.

Does that distinction make sense?

        self.__game_state_reporter__.request_game_state_change("resume_game")

do you see the problem with that thought?

Boots
Ah, I see the code you've provided again! You've updated the __init__ method to accept overlay_screen, which is a good step towards giving the manager class the resources it needs.

However, you've still defined the individual menu object instances (pause_title_pause_obj, quit_pause_obj, etc.) globally at the top of the file, outside the InteractableOverlayManager class.

Here's the challenge this creates:

Global Objects vs. Manager's List: The objects like quit_pause_obj are created once when the script starts, and they just exist globally.
Manager's Responsibility: Your InteractableOverlayManager class is designed to manage a list of these objects (self.overlay_objs).
The Disconnect: In your __init__, self.overlay_objs is initialized as an empty list (self.overlay_objs = []). The globally created objects are not automatically put into this list.
So, while the manager class now has the overlay_screen, the methods like interactable_overlay_objs_selection, interactable_overlay_objs_respacing, and interactable_overlay_request_new_game_state will operate on an empty self.overlay_objs list. They won't interact with the pause_title_pause_obj, quit_pause_obj, etc., that you created globally.

Does that make sense? The manager is ready to manage, but the objects it needs to manage haven't been given to it!

How might you adjust the __init__ method to create those menu objects and add them directly into the self.overlay_objs list when an InteractableOverlayManager is created? You would, of course, need access to things like screen_width and screen_height within that __init__ method as well.


Shaunythunder
so what do you suggest? turn them into attributes?

Boots
Ah, yes, turning them into attributes of the InteractableOverlayManager class is precisely the kind of organizational step I was suggesting!

Here's why that works well:

Encapsulation: The InteractableOverlayManager is responsible for managing these menu objects. Making them attributes means they belong to the manager instance itself, keeping the related parts of your code together.
Control over Creation: By creating them within the __init__ method of the manager, you have direct control over when and how they are created. They come into existence when the manager is created.
Populating the List: Once they are attributes (e.g., self.quit_obj, self.title_obj), you can easily add these self. attributes to the self.overlay_objs list right there in the __init__ method.
So, yes, modifying your __init__ method to create these instances and assign them to attributes (like self.pause_title, self.quit_button, etc.) and then adding them to self.overlay_objs would be a legitimate and clean way to structure this.

You would also need to ensure screen_width and screen_height are available within that __init__ method, likely by passing them in as arguments just like you did with overlay_screen.

Does that approach feel clearer? How might you start adding one of those menu items, like the quit button, as an attribute inside the __init__?


Shaunythunder
is that a common way to do it?

Boots
Yes, absolutely! Making objects that a class is responsible for managing into attributes of that class is a very common and standard practice in object-oriented programming.

It's a fundamental concept of encapsulation – bundling data (your menu objects) and the methods that operate on that data (the manager's methods for selection, spacing, input checking) together within a single unit (the InteractableOverlayManager class).

This approach helps make your code:

More organized: It's clear that these specific menu objects belong to and are managed by this specific manager.
Easier to reason about: When you're looking at the manager class, you can see what it's composed of and what it controls.
Less prone to errors: You reduce reliance on global variables, which can sometimes lead to unexpected side effects or naming conflicts.
So, yes, defining your menu objects as attributes within your InteractableOverlayManager is a solid and widely used design pattern for this kind of task.

Now that we've discussed this pattern, would you like me to quiz you on how you might implement it in your code, or perhaps explore another aspect of your manager class?

I don't like it because it has dependencies on itself

Boots
Ah, I understand you're not quite feeling settled with the structure yet. That's a wise perspective; noticing potential issues in your code is key to improving it!

When you say "dependencies on itself," could you elaborate a little on what you mean? Are you thinking about how certain parts rely on others?

Looking at the code you've shared, I see you've successfully moved the creation of the menu objects into the __init__ method and assigned them as attributes, which is great! You've also created a list called self.pause_menu_objs containing these attributes.

However, there are still a couple of spots that might feel like things aren't quite connected or flowing correctly:

The Working List: Your interactable_overlay_objs_selection, interactable_overlay_objs_respacing, and interactable_overlay_check_for_input methods all iterate over self.overlay_objs. In your __init__, you've created self.pause_menu_objs with the actual menu items, but self.overlay_objs is still initialized as an empty list after self.pause_menu_objs is populated. The methods will still be trying to work with an empty list.
Screen Dimensions: The creation of your menu objects (self.pause_title_pause_obj, etc.) still uses screen_width and screen_height. These variables aren't defined within the InteractableOverlayManager class or passed into the __init__ method, so the code trying to create these objects might encounter an error because screen_width and screen_height are not in scope.
Could one of those be the "dependency" you're noticing? Or is it something else entirely? Let's figure it out together!


Shaunythunder
Basically i got methods that require dynamic lists that change depending on the overlay you want

Boots
Ah, I understand now! You're seeing that this InteractableOverlayManager is currently very specific to the pause menu, but you need a way for it to handle different sets of interactable items for other overlays as well (like a main menu, or a game over screen), each with their own dynamic lists of objects. That's a very keen observation and a good direction to think!

You're right, the current manager is hardcoded for the pause menu objects you've created.

To make it more general and handle dynamic lists depending on the active overlay, you'll need a way to tell the InteractableOverlayManager which set of objects it should be interacting with at any given moment.

Think about this: How could the manager know, for example, that it should now be managing the "Main Menu" buttons instead of the "Pause Menu" buttons?

Consider these possibilities:

Could the manager hold all possible lists (e.g., self.pause_menu_objs, self.main_menu_objs, etc.) and switch which one it's currently using?
Could an external part of your game (like your GameStateManager) tell the InteractableOverlayManager which list is the "active" one?
How might you change the InteractableOverlayManager or how it's used so that its methods (interactable_overlay_objs_selection, interactable_overlay_objs_respacing, etc.) operate on the correct list of objects for the currently active overlay?


Shaunythunder
Well these lists will be static, but I also dont want a manager and a class list specific for every overlay I have

Boots
Ah, I understand perfectly! You have these distinct, static groups of interactable items (the pause menu items, the main menu items, etc.), and you want one InteractableOverlayManager instance to be able to handle whichever group is currently active, without having to create a whole new manager or duplicate logic for each. That's a very sensible goal for a cleaner design!

You're right, having the manager create all possible menu objects and lists directly in its __init__ (like you have with self.pause_menu_objs) makes it specific to one overlay type and feels a bit clunky if you need to handle others.

Instead of the manager owning all the lists of objects, consider this: What if the manager is given the list of objects it needs to manage when that overlay becomes active?

For example, when your game state switches to "paused," the logic handling that state change could:

Create the static list of pause menu objects (if they aren't already created somewhere).
Tell the InteractableOverlayManager instance, "Hey, start managing this list of objects now."
This way, the manager doesn't need to know about self.pause_menu_objs or self.main_menu_objs as permanent attributes. It just needs a place to store the current list it's working with.

How could you modify your InteractableOverlayManager class so that it has an attribute (let's call it self.current_interactive_objects) that gets updated with the list of objects it should operate on, and then update its methods (interactable_overlay_objs_selection, etc.) to use that attribute instead of self.overlay_objs?


Shaunythunder
I think its smarter to just have a stored list somewhere of the objects I want to make instead of having converting these to arguments every time. Basically what I discussed earlier expect I make a class that only has the purpose of storing lists and thier objects. I could single method. Set list and terminate list and basically what that does is inject any working list as the overlay list and then removes it

Boots
Ah, I see! You're thinking of centralizing the definitions of those static lists of objects (the pause menu objects, the main menu objects, and so on) into one dedicated place, like a separate class or module. And then, your InteractableOverlayManager would interact with that central storage.

That's a perfectly legitimate and often very clean way to handle static data! Storing related data together, separate from the logic that processes it, is a common and helpful pattern. It makes it easier to find and modify your menu layouts, for instance.

Your idea of methods like set_list and terminate_list on the manager (or perhaps on the storage class) is also one way to handle the transition. When the game state changes (e.g., from game play to paused), the main game loop or state manager could tell the InteractableOverlayManager to load the "pause menu list" from your storage, and then tell it to clear that list when returning to gameplay.

This approach keeps the InteractableOverlayManager focused on the logic of managing interactable items (selection, input, spacing), while the new storage class is focused on the data (the specific lists of objects for each overlay).

You've got a clear vision for how to organize the data. Now, thinking about the InteractableOverlayManager, how would it get access to this new storage class, and how would its methods be updated to use the list provided by the storage when an overlay is active?


Shaunythunder
how do I reset back to my previous commit

Boots
Ah, venturing back in time through the Git history, are we? A useful spell indeed!

To return your repository to a previous commit, you'll typically use the git reset command. It's a powerful tool, but use it with care, as it can discard work!

The most common way to reset and completely discard any changes made after that previous commit is using the --hard flag:

git reset --hard <commit-hash>

Replace <commit-hash> with the unique identifier of the commit you want to return to. You can find this hash using git log.

For example, if you wanted to go back to the commit right before your most recent one, you could use:

git reset --hard HEAD~1

HEAD refers to the current commit you are on.
HEAD~1 refers to the commit directly before HEAD.
Be aware that git reset --hard will discard any changes in your working directory and staging area that were made after the target commit. Make sure you've saved or committed anything important elsewhere if you don't want to lose it!

There are other ways to reset (--soft, --mixed), which affect the staging area and working directory differently, but --hard is usually what people mean when they want to wipe away subsequent changes.

Does that command help you return to the desired state?


Shaunythunder
anyway to go forward one?

Boots
Ah, you want to move forward, perhaps to a commit you were at before you used git reset?

The easiest way to do that is to find the specific commit hash of the commit you want to go to and then use git reset --hard to move your current branch pointer to that commit.

Find the commit hash: You can usually find the commit hash in your terminal history or by using git log. If you just ran git reset --hard HEAD~1, the hash of the commit you were just on will often be displayed in the output of the reset command. You can also often find lost commits using git reflog.

Reset forward: Once you have the hash (let's say it's abcdefg), you can use:

git reset --hard abcdefg

Remember, git reset --hard will make your working directory match the exact state of the commit you specify, potentially discarding any changes you might have made since that commit.

Does that make sense? Find the hash of the commit you want to reach, and then reset to it.


Shaunythunder
I'll have to brainstorm how I want the overlay system to work

Boots
Aha, a wise decision! Stepping back to ponder the structure and design of your systems is a sign of a thoughtful builder. Brainstorming how you want your overlay system to work, especially thinking about how it handles different states and manages its components, is a crucial step in building robust and maintainable code.

Take the time you need to think through the different possibilities. Designing how different parts of your program interact is like planning the layout of a dungeon or the flow of mana - getting it right early makes everything smoother down the line.

If you'd like to bounce any ideas around, or if you hit a snag in your thinking, just let me know! I'm here to help when you're ready. Happy thinking!


Shaunythunder
What I'll have to do is implement a master manager and then have a manager for each type of overlay. Master manager measures the state of the game and then picks the logic based on that.

Boots
Ah, that sounds like a very solid and common pattern for managing different parts of a game's user interface! Implementing a master manager that observes the game state and then delegates the handling to specific, dedicated managers for each overlay type is an excellent way to achieve:

Separation of Concerns: Each overlay manager (like a Pause Menu Manager or a Main Menu Manager) can focus purely on the logic and appearance of its specific overlay, without needing to worry about other parts of the game or other menus.
Clear Responsibility: The master manager has one job: know the current game state and activate/deactivate the appropriate overlay manager.
Scalability: As you add more overlays (options menu, game over screen, etc.), you simply create a new manager for that overlay and integrate it into the master manager's state-checking logic.
This design aligns nicely with the concept of a state machine, where the game transitions between states, and different systems (like your master overlay manager) react to those state changes by enabling the relevant sub-systems (the individual overlay managers).

It seems like you've landed on a promising architecture for your overlay system!

Now that you've mapped out this design, would you like to dive into how you might implement the master manager, or perhaps revisit how the individual overlay managers might work within this new structure? Or would you prefer a quick quiz on state management patterns?

how do I deal with a folder in a folder. on the visual code studio GUI it displays as overlays/pause_overlay and hten the contents

Boots
Ah, the visual representation of your project structure! Yes, VS Code and many other file explorers often condense a chain of single folders (like overlays containing only pause_overlay, which then contains files) to save space and make the hierarchy look less deep. It displays overlays/pause_overlay as one line, showing the path.

However, rest assured, on your actual file system (where the code lives), overlays is still a folder, and pause_overlay is still a distinct folder inside the overlays folder.

When you need to refer to files or modules within that nested structure, you simply use the full path just like you see it displayed:

If you have a file named menu_logic.py inside the pause_overlay folder, the full path is overlays/pause_overlay/menu_logic.py.
When you're writing Python code and want to import something from a file inside pause_overlay, you use the dot notation that mirrors the path: from overlays.pause_overlay import some_module or import overlays.pause_overlay.some_file.
So, while the GUI might condense the view, the actual structure is maintained, and you refer to files using the full, slash-separated (or dot-separated in imports) path from your project root.

Does that explanation help clear up how to work with those nested folders despite how they appear condensed in the editor's sidebar?


Shaunythunder
I did that specifically for the GUI because I eant it to work like windows exploerer

Boots
Ah, I understand! You prefer how the nested folders are visually presented in the VS Code sidebar when one folder contains only one other folder. That's a perfectly valid reason to structure your project this way!

Rest assured, creating folders like overlays and then putting another folder pause_overlay directly inside it is a standard way to organize files on any operating system, including what's happening behind the scenes when you use Windows Explorer or any other file manager. The GUI just has a special way of showing it to look cleaner.

So, your structure is solid for how file systems work and how Python imports work. Just remember that even if the GUI condenses overlays/pause_overlay visually, you still refer to items inside like overlays.pause_overlay.your_file in Python imports or navigate into them using the full path step-by-step in a terminal (cd overlays/pause_overlay).

It's good that you're structuring your project in a way that makes sense and feels organized to you!

Do you have any other questions about file structure or imports in Python?

Ah, crafting the visual elements for the game over screen! That's a crucial part of giving the player feedback. It looks like you've created classes to handle both the background box and the individual text elements.

This approach of creating classes like GameOverOverlay and GameOverObj to represent your UI components is a good way to keep your code organized and encapsulate the drawing logic for each piece.

As you're working on this, a couple of things caught my wise old bear eye that might be worth considering:

Method Naming in GameOverObj: Your class is called GameOverObj, but some of its methods are named draw_pause_menu_obj and draw_pause_title. This could be a bit confusing! It might be clearer if these methods had names that relate more directly to the GameOverObj class or simply describe what they do, like draw or draw_selectable_text and draw_title.
Docstring Confusion: The docstring for draw_pause_menu_obj mentions "selected from TitleScreen class". It seems this docstring might have been copied from elsewhere and doesn't quite fit the context of a GameOverObj being managed by an InteractableOverlayManager. Updating it to reflect its current role would add clarity.
These are just small points about clarity and consistency that can make your code easier to work with as the project grows.

You've made good progress here! Would you like me to go into more detail on the naming points, or would you prefer a quiz on how these object classes might interact with your manager?

Ah, an astute observation! You're pointing out the apparent contradiction between pre-rendering text (doing it once upfront) and needing to dynamically change its appearance based on whether it's selected. That's a very good question, and it highlights a nuance in how we handle text in Pygame.

You are absolutely correct that if the text's appearance (its size, color, etc.) needs to change whenever its state changes (like is_selected), you cannot simply pre-render just one version of it at the very beginning and use that forever.

My previous suggestion about pre-rendering generally applies when the text's appearance is static or changes very infrequently. Rendering text is computationally more expensive than simply blitting a surface, so we want to avoid rendering in the main game loop if possible.

However, in your draw_pause_menu_obj method, you are indeed re-rendering the selected version of the text every time the method is called if self.is_selected is True. This is the part that can impact performance.

The trick here is not to pre-render only one version, but to pre-render all the versions you might need.

In your case, you have two main visual states for the text:

Unselected: The original size and color.
Selected: A different size and color (red, size 64).
Instead of rendering the "selected" version every single frame inside the draw method, you could:

Render the unselected version once when the GameOverObj is created (which you already do with self.game_over_obj).
Render the selected version once when the object is created as well, and store that separate surface and rect (e.g., in self.selected_game_over_obj and self.selected_game_over_obj_rect).
Then, in your draw_pause_menu_obj method, simply check self.is_selected and blit the appropriate, already-rendered surface (self.game_over_obj or self.selected_game_over_obj) and its corresponding rect.
This way, you still handle the dynamic appearance change, but you avoid the expensive text rendering operation within your drawing loop.

Does that distinction make sense? You pre-render the states, not just one static version.


Shaunythunder
Oh so you are saying just have them pre stored and then just go temp = self.selected... and the rest of that. basically attribute flip

Boots
Precisely, my young friend! That's the core idea. You pre-render both the unselected and selected versions of the text surface and their rectangles when the GameOverObj is initialized.

Then, in your draw_pause_menu_obj method, you simply:

Check the value of self.is_selected.
If True, set your temporary variables (like temp_game_over_obj and temp_game_over_obj_rect) to point to the pre-rendered selected surface and rect attributes you stored.
If False, set the temporary variables to point to the pre-rendered unselected surface and rect attributes.
Finally, just blit using those temporary variables.
class GameOverObj:
    def __init__(self, text_font_size, text, text_color, text_pos_x, text_pos_y):
        # ... initial setup ...
        self.text = text
        self.text_font_size = text_font_size
        self.text_color = text_color
        self.text_pos_x = text_pos_x
        self.text_pos_y = text_pos_y
        self.is_selected = False

        # Pre-render the UNSELECTED state
        self.font = pygame.font.Font(None, text_font_size)
        self.unselected_surface = self.font.render(self.text, False, self.text_color, None)
        self.unselected_rect = self.unselected_surface.get_rect(center=(self.text_pos_x, self.text_pos_y))

        # Define and Pre-render the SELECTED state (Example values)
        selected_color = (255, 0, 0) # Red
        selected_font_size = 64
        selected_font = pygame.font.Font(None, selected_font_size) # Could reuse font object if only color changes
        self.selected_surface = selected_font.render(self.text, False, selected_color, None)
        # Get the rect centered at the SAME position as the unselected one
        self.selected_rect = self.selected_surface.get_rect(center=self.unselected_rect.center)


    def draw_pause_menu_obj(self, screen: pygame.Surface) -> None:
        """Draw the object, showing selection state."""
        if self.is_selected:
            surface_to_draw = self.selected_surface
            rect_to_draw = self.selected_rect
        else:
            surface_to_draw = self.unselected_surface
            rect_to_draw = self.unselected_rect

        # Draw the correct pre-rendered state on screen
        screen.blit(surface_to_draw, rect_to_draw)

    # ... rest of the class ...

This "attribute flip" pattern is very efficient because blit is a fast operation. The expensive part (rendering the text into a surface) happens only once per state when the object is created, not every frame.

You've grasped the concept perfectly! Would you like to refine this drawing logic further, or perhaps look at another aspect of your overlay system?


Shaunythunder
That make sense, you just gave me a lot of refactoring work 😛

Boots
Haha, yes, sometimes gaining wisdom requires a bit of effort in the code mines! Refactoring can feel like tidying up the whole cave, but it truly makes the code stronger and faster in the long run. Think of it as sharpening your claws before a hunt – a little work now pays off greatly later.

It's excellent that you see the logic behind it! If you run into any snags while you're restructuring things, just give a shout. I'm here to help navigate those refactoring paths.


Shaunythunder
Well lets see if I snap the game in half again

Boots
Go forth and code, young adventurer! It's through trying things out, even if it means the occasional stumble, that we truly learn and build mighty systems.

Don't fret too much about "snapping the game in half" – that's a natural part of the development journey! It's how we discover where the foundations need strengthening.

Best of luck with the refactoring! If you find any unexpected glitches or need a paw with debugging, you know where to find me.

Would you like me to be ready to help debug, or perhaps try a quick quiz on the concepts we've discussed once you're done coding?


Shaunythunder
So why is it all of the sudden appearing at the bottom of screen now when selected

Boots
Ah, a tricky spatial anomaly! Text zipping off to the bottom of the screen when selected does sound like a puzzling behavior.

Based on our previous chat about pre-rendering states, the most likely culprit for this kind of positioning issue is the rectangle (rect) associated with the selected version of the text.

When you render text with a different size or font, the resulting pygame.Surface for the text will have different dimensions. If the rect you get for this new surface doesn't have its position (like its topleft or center) set correctly, Pygame will just blit it at a default position (often (0,0) relative to its container surface, or wherever its topleft is if you got the rect without specifying a position).

It sounds like the rect for your selected text isn't being told to appear at the same desired location as your unselected text.

Could you show me the code where you are creating and storing the surface and rectangle for the selected state of your GameOverObj? We can look at how that rectangle's position is being set.

Boots
Ah, a puzzling spatial distortion! If the text is suddenly appearing near the bottom of the screen when selected, it does sound like a coordinates or positioning issue, likely involving the rectangle (rect) used for drawing the selected text.

Let's look at the code you provided, specifically in your PauseMenuObj.__init__:

        #


Shaunythunder
continue'

Boots
Ah yes, apologies, I seem to have trailed off like a bear daydreaming about honey! Let's pick up with that __init__ method you showed:

class PauseMenuObj:
    def __init__(self,
                 text_font_size: int,
                 text: str,
                 text_color: tuple[int, int, int],
                 text_pos_x: float,
                 text_pos_y: float):
        # ... (unselected state setup) ...

        # Pre-render the UNSELECTED state
        self.font = pygame.font.Font(None, text_font_size)
        self.pause_menu_obj = self.font.render(self.text, False, self.text_color, None)
        self.pause_menu_obj_rect = self.pause_menu_obj.get_rect(center=(self.text_pos_x, self.text_pos_y))

        # Define and Pre-render the SELECTED state
        self.selected_font = pygame.font.Font(None, text_font_size * 2)
        self.selected_pause_menu_obj = self.selected_font.render(self.text, False, (255, 0, 0), None)
        self.selected_pause_menu_obj_rect = self.selected_pause_menu_obj.get_rect(center=(self.text_pos_x, self.text_pos_y)) # <-- Look here!

    # ... rest of the class ...

You are correctly pre-rendering both surfaces and getting their rectangles. The key line for positioning is this one:

self.selected_pause_menu_obj_rect = self.selected_pause_menu_obj.get_rect(center=(self.text_pos_x, self.text_pos_y))

This line tells Pygame to create a rectangle for the self.selected_pause_menu_obj surface and then position that rectangle so its center is at the coordinates (self.text_pos_x, self.text_pos_y).

You are using the same text_pos_x and text_pos_y for the center of both the unselected and selected rectangles.

So, the positioning issue isn't likely in the draw method itself, but rather in what values are being passed in as text_pos_x and text_pos_y when you create the PauseMenuObj instances outside this class.

For example, if the PauseMenuObj for the "Quit" option is created with text_pos_y set to screen_height, both its unselected and selected versions will attempt to center themselves vertically at the very bottom of the screen. If the title is created with text_pos_y set to screen_height // 3, both its versions will center themselves there.

Could the coordinates (text_pos_x, text_pos_y) you are passing when creating the specific PauseMenuObj instances (like the title or one of the menu options) be the reason the selected text ends up in an unexpected place? Perhaps the value for text_pos_y is leading it to the bottom of the screen for that particular object?

Ah, thank you for sharing the PauseMenuManager code! This helps connect the pieces and understand how the PauseMenuObj instances are being created and potentially moved.

Looking at your PauseMenuManager class, particularly the pause_menu_objs_respacing method:

    def pause_menu_objs_respacing(self) -> None:
        """Handles the respacing of pause menu objects based on screen height."""
        # Logic for automated spacing for pause menu objects
        start_y = self._screen_height // 2
        end_y = 250 # Note: This end_y seems low compared to screen_height // 2
        pause_menu_obj_respacing_len = len(self.pause_menu_objs)
        # Establishes a y coordinate range and then evenly spaces the objects
        spacing = -((end_y - start_y) // (pause_menu_obj_respacing_len - 1))
        for i, obj in enumerate(self.pause_menu_objs):
            if i == 0:
                pass # Title object isn't respaced
            else:
                # This line updates the position of the UNSELECTED rect
                obj.pause_menu_obj_rect.centery = start_y + i * spacing

Here's the key: The respacing method only modifies the centery property of obj.pause_menu_obj_rect.

However, if you look back at your PauseMenuObj.__init__, you have two rectangle attributes: self.pause_menu_obj_rect (for the unselected text) and self.selected_pause_menu_obj_rect (for the selected text). Both are initially centered using the text_pos_x and text_pos_y values passed into __init__.

Your draw_pause_menu_obj method then decides which rectangle (pause_menu_obj_rect or selected_pause_menu_obj_rect) to use for bliting based on self.is_selected.

So, the respacing method moves the unselected rectangle to the correct, spaced position, but it doesn't touch the selected rectangle. When an item becomes selected, the draw method switches to using the selected_pause_menu_obj_rect, which is still sitting at its initial position from the __init__ call (e.g., screen_width // 2, screen_height for the Quit button).

To fix this, you need to update the position of both rectangles in the pause_menu_objs_respacing method.

How could you modify the line obj.pause_menu_obj_rect.centery = start_y + i * spacing to also apply the same calculated centery to the obj.selected_pause_menu_obj_rect?


Shaunythunder
Oh so I need to do that for the selected ones too

Boots
Exactly! You've hit the nail on the head, young builder. Since your PauseMenuObj holds two separate rectangle objects (pause_menu_obj_rect and selected_pause_menu_obj_rect), and your draw_pause_menu_obj method uses one or the other depending on the selected state, the respacing method needs to update the position of both of those rectangles for each object.

If respacing only moves the pause_menu_obj_rect, the selected_pause_menu_obj_rect stays stuck at its initial position defined in __init__. Then, when is_selected becomes True, the draw method suddenly starts using the rectangle that hasn't been moved by the respacing logic.

How would you add a line inside your respacing loop to also update the centery of the selected_pause_menu_obj_rect for each object?


Shaunythunder
Yup that fixed it'

Boots
Excellent! I'm glad to hear that resolved the spatial mystery and got your selected text appearing in the right place. Well done tracking down that subtle detail!

It's often those small interactions between different parts of the code, like the respacing logic and the different rectangle objects, that can cause unexpected behavior. Debugging is all about uncovering those connections.

Now that you've conquered that challenge, would you like me to quiz you on any of the concepts we've covered, or do you have more questions about your code or the project?

def create_overlay(self) -> None:
    overlay_screen = self.non_interactive_overlay_screen
    overlay_screen.fill((0, 0, 0, 0))  # Clear the display screen

Boots
Ah, a peek into your overlay creation process! Using a separate surface (self.non_interactive_overlay_screen) for your overlay before drawing it onto the main screen is a common technique in Pygame.

The line overlay_screen.fill((0, 0, 0, 0)) is essentially clearing this specific overlay_screen surface. The (0, 0, 0, 0) color tuple includes an alpha value (0), meaning it's filling the surface with fully transparent black. This is a standard way to make a surface see-through in Pygame if that surface supports an alpha channel.

The comment "# Clear the display screen" might be slightly inaccurate, as this line clears the overlay_screen surface itself, not the main game window surface that Pygame draws everything onto. Clearing the main display usually happens right before drawing each frame.

Using a transparent overlay surface like this allows you to draw elements (like text, boxes, etc.) onto the overlay surface first, and then blit that entire overlay surface onto your main screen. This way, only the pixels you explicitly draw onto the overlay surface will appear, and the rest will be transparent, letting the game beneath show through.

It looks like a solid start for creating a non-interactive overlay!

Do you have any specific questions about this process, or would you like me to quiz you on using surfaces and alpha channels in Pygame?


Shaunythunder
Its the start of a HUD

Boots
Ah, an excellent use of a transparent surface then! Using it as the base for your Heads-Up Display (HUD) is a very common and effective technique in Pygame.

Filling it with (0, 0, 0, 0) ensures that the parts of the HUD surface where you don't draw anything will be completely transparent, allowing the game visuals underneath to be seen. You can then draw your scores, health bars, maps, or whatever elements your HUD needs onto this overlay_screen surface, and finally blit the whole overlay_screen onto your main display surface each frame.

It sounds like you're on the right track for building out your game's interface!

Keep up the great work! Do you have any specific questions about adding elements to your HUD, or would you like me to quiz you on the concepts we've touched upon?

what do you think on the initial hud

Boots
Ah, a fine start to managing your non-interactive elements, like the HUD! Using a manager class to oversee this based on the game state is a solid approach.

Here's what I see:

Manager Structure: Having a NonInteractiveOverlayManager that holds references to other handlers and the surfaces is a good organizational step. It centralizes the responsibility of displaying different overlays.
Clear Overlay: The create_overlay method correctly clears your non_interactive_overlay_screen surface each time it's called. This ensures that whatever you draw onto it next frame starts fresh on a transparent background, preventing old drawings from lingering.
State-Based Drawing: Your draw_overlay method checks the game state and calls create_overlay. This is where you'd place the drawing logic specific to each mode (like "asteroids_mode", "galaga_mode", etc.). Currently, you have pass statements, which means nothing specific is being drawn for each mode before the blank transparent surface is blitted.
Updating Logic: The update_overlay method is the right place to put any logic that changes the state of your HUD elements (e.g., updating a score counter, checking player health to change a health bar).
So, the structure is there, but the actual drawing code (like drawing text for score or a health bar) needs to be added in the appropriate state blocks within your draw_overlay method, right after self.create_overlay() and before display_screen.blit(overlay_screen, (0, 0)). The update_overlay is where you'd prepare the data to be drawn.

It looks like you're well on your way to building out your HUD! Would you like me to elaborate on where to add the drawing logic, or perhaps discuss how the update_overlay might interact with the drawing?

sorry this is the overally manager for non interactive overlays

Boots
Ah, my apologies! I seem to have followed a rabbit trail there. Thank you for clarifying that this manager is specifically for non-interactive overlays, like your HUD or perhaps other static display elements.

Yes, your current structure is perfectly suited for that purpose! A NonInteractiveOverlayManager that checks the game state ("asteroids_mode", "galaga_mode", etc.) and then handles the drawing of the correct non-interactive elements onto a dedicated surface before bliting it to the main screen is a very clean design.

The create_overlay method correctly prepares the transparent canvas, and the state blocks within draw_overlay are precisely where you would place the code to draw scores, player lives, icons, or any other information specific to that game mode's HUD onto the self.non_interactive_overlay_screen surface. The update_overlay method, as we discussed, is where you'd put any logic to change the data being displayed.

So, rest assured, this manager is well-structured for handling those passive visual elements based on your game's state.

It seems you've got the blueprint ready for your non-interactive overlays! Do you have any questions about adding specific drawing commands (like drawing text or shapes) within those state blocks, or would you like me to test your understanding with a quick quiz?

git amned

Boots
Ah, the git commit --amend command! A handy tool indeed for refining your most recent magical inscription (commit).

What git commit --amend does is allow you to change your last commit. Instead of creating a new commit with your changes, it takes your current staged changes (or allows you to edit the previous commit message) and combines them with the previous commit, replacing it entirely.

It's most often used when:

You just committed but immediately realized you forgot to stage a small change.
You need to fix a typo in your previous commit message.
You stage the additional changes (or make the message edits) and then run git commit --amend.

Important Note: Because it rewrites history, it's generally not recommended to use git commit --amend on commits that you have already pushed to a shared remote repository. Doing so can cause confusion and issues for others who have pulled that original commit.

Does that explanation clarify what git commit --amend is used for?


Shaunythunder
git commit amend -m

Boots
Ah, you're looking to use the --amend command specifically with a new message!

git commit --amend -m "<your new message>" does exactly that:

It takes your current staged changes (if any).
It combines those staged changes with your previous commit.
It replaces the message of that previous commit with the one you provide using the -m flag.
So, if you just want to fix a typo in your last commit message without changing any files, you simply run git commit --amend -m "Corrected message". If you staged some additional changes and also want to change the message, you stage the changes first, then run the command with the new message.

It's a convenient shortcut compared to running git commit --amend and then editing the message in a separate editor window.

Just remember the caution about using --amend on commits you've already shared with others!

Does that make sense?
