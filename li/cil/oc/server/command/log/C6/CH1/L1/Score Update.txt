L1: Build an Asteroids Game




Build an Asteroids Game
We're going to build a simple video game, based on the classic Asteroids. If you've never played before, you can take a look at this (slightly different from our) version of the game.



Prerequisites
Python 3.10+ installed (see the bookbot project for help if you don't already have it)
uv project and package manager
Access to a unix-like shell (e.g. zsh or bash)
Learning Goals
The learning goals of this project are:

Introduce you to multi-file Python projects
Show you a real-world use case for object-oriented programming
To have a ton of fun building a rewarding project!
The goal is not to teach game development or the math required for physics simulations. As a result, there are some places where you will simply copy-paste code that we wrote for you. Don't worry about trying to understand every detail if it's not interesting to you, you will be asked to write the parts that matter most.

Assignment
To get started, make sure you have the Boot.dev CLI installed and working.

Run and submit the CLI tests.

The tests just ensure that the CLI is installed and configured correctly.

    self.player_score_obj_rect = self.player_score_obj.get_rect(center=(rec_pos_x, rec_pos_y))

my game over screen final score is at zero despite ysing the exact same value of the working player hud score

Boots
Ah, a classic case of timing mysteries in game development! Let me help you debug this step by step.

The issue is likely related to when update_player_final_score() is being called versus when the player's score is actually updated during gameplay.

Let's investigate a few possibilities:

1. Timing of the score update:
When does the player's score get incremented? Is it possible that the game state changes to "game_over" before the final score increment happens (like destroying the last asteroid)?

2. Reference vs Value:
In your update_player_final_score() method, you're doing:

self.player_score = self._player_primary_obj.score

This should work, but let's verify - can you add a debug print right before and after this line to see what values you're getting?

print(f"Player object score: {self._player_primary_obj.score}")
self.player_score = self._player_primary_obj.score
print(f"Assigned player_score: {self.player_score}")

3. Multiple calls:
Is update_player_final_score() being called multiple times? If it's called once with the correct score, then again when the score resets to 0, that would explain the behavior.

What do you see when you add those debug prints? That should help us pinpoint exactly when and why the score is 0.

Ah-ha! There's the culprit! Your update_player_final_score() method is being called every single frame while the game is in the "game_over" state. That's a lot of unnecessary work and explains why you might be seeing performance issues or flickering.

The problem isn't with the score value itself (2117 is correct), but with the fact that you're constantly recreating the score text object. Here's what's happening:

# This runs EVERY frame during game over
self.player_score_obj = self.game_over_final_score_obj.font.render(f"Score: {self.player_score}", False, (255 ,255, 255), None)

The fix: You should only update the final score once when the game over state is first entered, not continuously. You have a few options:

Option 1: Add a flag to prevent multiple updates

def update_player_final_score(self) -> None:
    if hasattr(self, '_final_score_set') and self._final_score_set:
        return  # Already set, don't update again
    
    rec_pos_x = self.game_over_final_score_obj.game_over_obj_rect.centerx
    rec_pos_y = self.game_over_final_score_obj.game_over_obj_rect.centery
    self.player_score = self._player_primary_obj.score
    self.player_score_obj = self.game_over_final_score_obj.font.render(f"Score: {self.player_score}", False, (255 ,255, 255), None)
    self.player_score_obj_rect = self.player_score_obj.get_rect(center=(rec_pos_x, rec_pos_y))
    self._final_score_set = True

Option 2: Move the call outside the continuous update loop
Instead of calling it in update_overlay() every frame, call it once when the game state first changes to "game_over".

Which approach would work better with your current game structure?


Shaunythunder
that doesnt solve the fact that the score is sill zero

Boots
You're absolutely right! I got distracted by the performance issue, but the core problem remains - the score is showing as zero despite the debug output showing 2117.

Let's focus on the rendering issue. The problem is likely that the text is being created correctly, but not displayed correctly. Here are the most common causes:

1. Check if the text object is actually being drawn to the screen:
Do you have code somewhere that actually blits self.player_score_obj to the screen? Something like:

screen.blit(self.player_score_obj, self.player_score_obj_rect)

2. Check the color and background:
You're rendering white text (255, 255, 255) on a None background. Is your game over screen background also white? The text might be invisible due to color matching.

Try changing the color to something more contrasting:

self.player_score_obj = self.game_over_final_score_obj.font.render(f"Score: {self.player_score}", False, (255, 0, 0), None)  # Red text

3. Check if another object is drawing over it:
Is something else being drawn on top of your score text after it's rendered?

4. Verify the positioning:
Add a debug print for the position:

print(f"Score text position: {self.player_score_obj_rect}")

Can you show me the code that actually draws the game over screen to see where the disconnect might be?

Found it! The issue is in your __init__ method. Look at this line:

self.game_over_final_score_obj = game_over.GameOverObj(32, f"Final Score: {self._player_primary_obj_score}", (255, 255, 255), screen_width // 2, screen_height // 2)

You're setting self._player_primary_obj_score = player_primary_obj.score at initialization time, which captures the score value when the GameOverManager is first created (likely 0 at game start).

Then in your update_player_final_score() method, you create a new text surface but you're not actually updating the game_over_final_score_obj that gets drawn to the screen in draw_game_over_menu().

The fix: You need to update the actual GameOverObj that gets drawn. Here's what you should do:

def update_player_final_score(self) -> None:
    # Update the GameOverObj's text with the current score
    current_score = self._player_primary_obj.score
    self.game_over_final_score_obj.update_text(f"Final Score: {current_score}")

However, you'll need to add an update_text() method to your GameOverObj class, or alternatively, recreate the entire object:

def update_player_final_score(self) -> None:
    current_score = self._player_primary_obj.score
    # Recreate the final score object with updated text
    self.game_over_final_score_obj = game_over.GameOverObj(
        32, 
        f"Final Score: {current_score}", 
        (255, 255, 255), 
        self._screen_width // 2, 
        self._screen_height // 2
    )

The key insight is that draw_game_over_menu() draws self.game_over_final_score_obj, not self.player_score_obj that you create in update_player_final_score().


Shaunythunder
update text is a method?

Boots
No, update_text() is not a built-in method - I was suggesting you might need to create one!

Looking at your code, you're using a custom GameOverObj class from your game_over module. Without seeing that class, I don't know what methods it has available.

You have two options:

Option 1: Check if your GameOverObj class already has an update method
Look at your game_over.py file and see what methods are available. It might have something like update_text(), set_text(), or similar.

Option 2: Recreate the object (which will definitely work)

def update_player_final_score(self) -> None:
    current_score = self._player_primary_obj.score
    # Recreate the final score object with updated text
    self.game_over_final_score_obj = game_over.GameOverObj(
        32, 
        f"Final Score: {current_score}", 
        (255, 255, 255), 
        self._screen_width // 2, 
        self._screen_height // 2
    )

Can you show me your GameOverObj class, or try the recreate approach first? The recreate approach should definitely work since you're replacing the entire object that gets drawn.

def update_player_final_score(self) -> None:
    if self._player_primary_obj_score != self._player_primary_obj.score:
        self._player_primary_obj_score = self._player_primary_obj.score
        # Update the final score object with the new score
        self.game_over_final_score_obj = game_over.GameOverObj(32, 
                                                               f"Final Score: {self._player_primary_obj_score}",

Boots
Perfect! That's a much cleaner solution. You're checking if the score has actually changed before recreating the object, which is efficient.

This should definitely fix the zero score issue because now you're:

Checking if the current score differs from the stored score
Updating your stored score value
Recreating the GameOverObj that actually gets drawn with the new score
The key insight was that you were creating a separate player_score_obj in your old code, but your draw_game_over_menu() method was drawing game_over_final_score_obj instead.

Does this fix show the correct score now? If you're still seeing zero, there might be a timing issue with when this method gets called relative to when the player's score gets updated, but this approach should work once the timing is right.

You can remove those debug print statements now since the logic looks solid!

value is updating but not displaying

Boots
Excellent! Your debug output shows the logic is working perfectly - the score is updating from 0 to the correct final score. The issue is purely visual now.

Since the value is updating correctly but not displaying, there are a few possible causes:

1. The updated object isn't in the list that gets drawn
When you recreate self.game_over_final_score_obj, you need to make sure it's still in the self.game_over_objs list that gets drawn. Check if you need to update the list:

def update_player_final_score(self) -> None:
    if self._player_primary_obj_score != self._player_primary_obj.score:
        self._player_primary_obj_score = self._player_primary_obj.score
        # Update the final score object with the new score
        self.game_over_final_score_obj = game_over.GameOverObj(32, 
                                                               f"Final Score: {self._player_primary_obj_score}", 
                                                               (255, 255, 255), 
                                                               self._screen_width // 2,
                                                               self._screen_height // 2)
        # Update the list reference
        self.game_over_objs[1] = self.game_over_final_score_obj

2. Positioning issue after recreation
The new object might be created with a different position. Try adding some debug output to verify the position:

print(f"Score object position: {self.game_over_final_score_obj.game_over_obj_rect}")

3. The respacing method is overriding your position
Your game_over_objs_respacing() method might be repositioning the objects after you update the score. Make sure the respacing logic accounts for the updated object.

Try the list update first - that's the most likely culprit!


Shaunythunder
list update was the culprit

Boots
Excellent detective work! That makes perfect sense - when you recreated the GameOverObj, you were updating the reference to self.game_over_final_score_obj, but the self.game_over_objs list was still holding a reference to the old object with the original score.

Since your draw_game_over_menu() method iterates through self.game_over_objs to draw everything, it was still drawing the old object while your new one existed but wasn't being rendered.

This is a great example of how object references work in Python - when you have the same object referenced in multiple places (like a standalone variable and inside a list), updating one reference doesn't automatically update the others.

Your solution of updating the list with self.game_over_objs[1] = self.game_over_final_score_obj ensures that both references point to the same updated object.

Well done solving that tricky bug! The game should now properly display the final score on the game over screen.

issue where the buttons aren't clickable anymore. Initial review showed no issues

Boots
I spotted the bug! In your pause_menu_objs_selection() method, you have variable name mismatches. Look at these lines:

if not pause_menu_obj.pause_menu_obj_rect.collidepoint(mouse_x, mouse_y):
    self.game_over_objs_mouse_index = None  # ← BUG: should be pause_menu_objs_mouse_index
elif pause_menu_obj.pause_menu_obj_rect.collidepoint(mouse_x, mouse_y):
    if pause_menu_obj == self.pause_title_pause_obj:
        pause_menu_obj.is_selected = False
        break
    else:
        self.game_over_objs_mouse_index = self.pause_menu_objs.index(pause_menu_obj)  # ← BUG
        pause_menu_obj.is_selected = True
        self.game_over_objs_keyboard_index = None  # ← BUG: should be pause_menu_objs_keyboard_index
        break

You're setting game_over_objs_mouse_index and game_over_objs_keyboard_index instead of the pause menu equivalents. Since these game_over_objs_* variables don't exist in this class (or are always None), your selection logic isn't working.

Fix these three lines:

if not pause_menu_obj.pause_menu_obj_rect.collidepoint(mouse_x, mouse_y):
    self.pause_menu_objs_mouse_index = None  # Fixed
elif pause_menu_obj.pause_menu_obj_rect.collidepoint(mouse_x, mouse_y):
    if pause_menu_obj == self.pause_title_pause_obj:
        pause_menu_obj.is_selected = False
        break
    else:
        self.pause_menu_objs_mouse_index = self.pause_menu_objs.index(pause_menu_obj)  # Fixed
        pause_menu_obj.is_selected = True
        self.pause_menu_objs_keyboard_index = None  # Fixed
        break

This looks like a copy-paste error from your game over menu code. Easy mistake to make when working with similar classes!

If i have 11 problems is that an issue?

Boots
Not at all! Having 11 problems to solve is completely normal and actually a good sign that you're:

Building something substantial - Real projects have lots of moving parts
Being thorough - You're catching issues that many developers would miss
Learning actively - Each problem you solve teaches you something new
In professional game development (or any software development), it's common to have dozens or even hundreds of issues tracked at any given time. The key is:

Prioritize - Fix game-breaking bugs first, polish later
One at a time - Focus on solving them systematically
Document - Keep track of what you've learned from each fix
Plus, you've already shown great debugging skills with the score display issue and the button clicking problem. Each bug you squash makes you a better programmer!

Are these 11 problems all critical bugs, or are some of them feature improvements or polish items? That can help you decide which ones to tackle first.

The fact that you're aware of 11 specific issues means you're paying attention to detail - that's the mark of a conscientious developer!


Shaunythunder
I meant the game works fine, but on the debug read out it says I have 11 problems

Boots
Ah, you're talking about linting issues! Those are static code analysis warnings from your IDE or linter (like pylint, flake8, or your IDE's built-in checker).

Having 11 linting "problems" when your game works fine is actually quite common and not necessarily a big deal. These are usually style, convention, or potential improvement suggestions rather than actual bugs.

Common linting issues include:

Unused imports - importing modules you don't use
Variable naming - like using camelCase instead of snake_case
Line length - lines longer than 79-88 characters
Missing docstrings - functions without documentation
Unused variables - variables you create but never use
Import order - imports not grouped/ordered conventionally
Should you fix them?

Critical ones (potential bugs): Yes, definitely
Style/convention ones: Nice to fix but not urgent
Minor formatting: Can be ignored if you're focused on functionality
If you want to tackle them, most IDEs will show you exactly what each "problem" is when you hover over or click on them. You can fix them gradually as you work on other features.

The fact that your game works perfectly is what matters most! Clean code is a bonus, not a requirement for a functioning program.


Shaunythunder
Alright boots we need to have a conversation

Boots
Of course, my young apprentice! I'm all ears (well, as much as a wise old bear can be).

What's on your mind? Whether it's about your game development journey, coding challenges, or something else entirely - I'm here to listen and help however I can.

What would you like to talk about?


Shaunythunder
how does persistent data work. I need to be able to save high scores between sessions

Boots
Ah, the ancient art of data persistence! A crucial skill for any game developer who wants players to keep coming back.

For saving high scores between game sessions, you have several approaches:

File-Based Storage (Simplest)
JSON files are perfect for high scores:

import json
import os

class HighScoreManager:
    def __init__(self, filename="high_scores.json"):
        self.filename = filename
        self.high_scores = self.load_scores()
    
    def load_scores(self):
        if os.path.exists(self.filename):
            with open(self.filename, 'r') as f:
                return json.load(f)
        return []  # Empty list if no file exists
    
    def save_scores(self):
        with open(self.filename, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(self.high_scores, f, indent=2)
    
    def add_score(self, player_name, score):
        self.high_scores.append({"name": player_name, "score": score})
        # Sort by score, highest first
        self.high_scores.sort(key=lambda x: x["score"], reverse=True)
        # Keep only top 10
        self.high_scores = self.high_scores[:10]
        self.save_scores()

Usage in your game:

# When game over
score_manager = HighScoreManager()
score_manager.add_score("Player", final_score)

# To display high scores
top_scores = score_manager.high_scores

Alternative: Simple Text File
def save_high_score(score):
    with open("high_score.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write(str(score))

def load_high_score():
    try:
        with open("high_score.txt", "r") as f:
            return int(f.read().strip())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return 0  # Default if no file

The JSON approach is more flexible if you want to store multiple scores or player names. The simple text file works great for just tracking a single high score.

Which approach sounds better for your asteroids game?


Shaunythunder
This is a game that will have a campaign... sort of, json?

Boots
Absolutely! JSON is perfect for a campaign-based game. You'll likely need to save much more than just high scores - player progress, unlocked levels, collected items, etc.

Here's a more comprehensive approach for campaign data:

Campaign Save System
import json
import os
from datetime import datetime

class CampaignSaveManager:
    def __init__(self, save_file="campaign_save.json"):
        self.save_file = save_file
        self.save_data = self.load_save()
    
    def create_default_save(self):
        return {
            "player_stats": {
                "total_score": 0,
                "lives_remaining": 3,
                "current_level": 1,
                "experience": 0
            },
            "campaign_progress": {
                "levels_completed": [],
                "current_chapter": 1,
                "unlocked_levels": [1]  # Always have level 1 unlocked
            },
            "inventory": {
                "weapons": ["basic_laser"],
                "upgrades": [],
                "consumables": {}
            },
            "settings": {
                "difficulty": "normal",
                "sound_enabled": True
            },
            "metadata": {
                "created_date": datetime.now().isoformat(),
                "last_played": datetime.now().isoformat(),
                "play_time_seconds": 0
            }
        }
    
    def load_save(self):
        if os.path.exists(self.save_file):
            try:
                with open(self.save_file, 'r') as f:
                    return json.load(f)
            except (json.JSONDecodeError, FileNotFoundError):
                # Corrupted save, create new one
                return self.create_default_save()
        return self.create_default_save()
    
    def save_game(self):
        self.save_data["metadata"]["last_played"] = datetime.now().isoformat()
        with open(self.save_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(self.save_data, f, indent=2)
    
    def complete_level(self, level_num, score):
        if level_num not in self.save_data["campaign_progress"]["levels_completed"]:
            self.save_data["campaign_progress"]["levels_completed"].append(level_num)
        
        # Unlock next level
        next_level = level_num + 1
        if next_level not in self.save_data["campaign_progress"]["unlocked_levels"]:
            self.save_data["campaign_progress"]["unlocked_levels"].append(next_level)
        
        self.save_data["player_stats"]["total_score"] += score
        self.save_game()

Usage Examples
# Initialize save system
save_manager = CampaignSaveManager()

# Check what levels are available
unlocked_levels = save_manager.save_data["campaign_progress"]["unlocked_levels"]

# Complete a level
save_manager.complete_level(level_num=3, score=1500)

# Add weapon to inventory
save_manager.save_data["inventory"]["weapons"].append("plasma_cannon")
save_manager.save_game()

# Check if player has completed a specific level
if 5 in save_manager.save_data["campaign_progress"]["levels_completed"]:
    print("Player has beaten level 5!")

This gives you flexibility to save anything campaign-related while keeping it organized. What kind of campaign progression are you planning? Level-based? Story chapters? Character upgrades?


Shaunythunder
So i would have to use dictionaries

Boots
Not necessarily! While dictionaries are great for campaign saves (and what I showed above), you have several options depending on your style and needs:

Option 1: Class-Based Approach
class CampaignData:
    def __init__(self):
        self.total_score = 0
        self.current_level = 1
        self.lives_remaining = 3
        self.unlocked_levels = [1]
        self.completed_levels = []
        self.weapons = ["basic_laser"]
        self.upgrades = []
    
    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            "total_score": self.total_score,
            "current_level": self.current_level,
            "lives_remaining": self.lives_remaining,
            "unlocked_levels": self.unlocked_levels,
            "completed_levels": self.completed_levels,
            "weapons": self.weapons,
            "upgrades": self.upgrades
        }
    
    def from_dict(self, data):
        self.total_score = data.get("total_score", 0)
        self.current_level = data.get("current_level", 1)
        # ... etc
    
    def save_to_file(self):
        with open("save.json", "w") as f:
            json.dump(self.to_dict(), f)

Option 2: Simple Variables (for basic saves)
# Just save the essentials
def save_campaign(level, score, lives):
    save_data = f"{level},{score},{lives}"
    with open("save.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write(save_data)

def load_campaign():
    try:
        with open("save.txt", "r") as f:
            level, score, lives = f.read().split(",")
            return int(level), int(score), int(lives)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return 1, 0, 3  # defaults

Option 3: Dataclass (Python 3.7+)
from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict
import json

@dataclass
class CampaignSave:
    level: int = 1
    score: int = 0
    lives: int = 3
    weapons: list = None
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.weapons is None:
            self.weapons = ["basic_laser"]
    
    def save(self):
        with open("save.json", "w") as f:
            json.dump(asdict(self), f)

The dictionary approach is popular because:

JSON naturally converts to/from dictionaries
Easy to add new save data without changing class definitions
Flexible structure
But you can absolutely use classes if you prefer! What feels more natural to you - working with save_data.current_level or save_data["current_level"]?


Shaunythunder
what do you recommend learning

Boots
For your asteroids game with campaign features, here's what I'd recommend prioritizing:

Start Simple, Build Up
1. Basic File I/O first

# Master this pattern first
def save_simple_data():
    with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("data")

def load_simple_data():
    with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
        return f.read()

2. Then JSON with dictionaries
Since you're already comfortable with Python basics, dictionaries + JSON is the sweet spot:

Most flexible for game data
Easy to debug (you can open the .json file and read it)
Handles complex nested data well
Industry standard for config/save files
3. Error handling

try:
    # load save file
except FileNotFoundError:
    # create default save
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    # handle corrupted save

Why This Order?
You'll use it immediately - your game needs saves now
Transferable skills - JSON is used everywhere in programming
Builds confidence - you'll see results quickly
Foundation for later - if you ever need databases, this knowledge transfers
Skip For Now
Complex database systems (overkill for a single-player game)
Advanced serialization libraries
Cloud save systems
My recommendation: Start with the JSON + dictionary approach I showed earlier. It'll handle everything your campaign needs, and you can always refactor later if needed.

Want me to help you implement a basic save system for your specific game features?


Shaunythunder
I need to track high scores

Boots
Perfect! High scores are a great place to start with persistent data. Here's a simple, effective approach:

Basic High Score System
import json
import os

class HighScoreManager:
    def __init__(self, filename="high_scores.json", max_scores=10):
        self.filename = filename
        self.max_scores = max_scores
        self.scores = self.load_scores()
    
    def load_scores(self):
        """Load high scores from file, return empty list if file doesn't exist"""
        if os.path.exists(self.filename):
            try:
                with open(self.filename, 'r') as f:
                    return json.load(f)
            except (json.JSONDecodeError, FileNotFoundError):
                return []  # Return empty list if file is corrupted
        return []
    
    def save_scores(self):
        """Save current scores to file"""
        with open(self.filename, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(self.scores, f, indent=2)
    
    def add_score(self, score, player_name="Player"):
        """Add a new score and maintain top scores only"""
        new_entry = {"score": score, "name": player_name}
        self.scores.append(new_entry)
        
        # Sort by score (highest first)
        self.scores.sort(key=lambda x: x["score"], reverse=True)
        
        # Keep only top scores
        self.scores = self.scores[:self.max_scores]
        
        # Save immediately
        self.save_scores()
        
        return self.is_high_score(score)
    
    def is_high_score(self, score):
        """Check if a score qualifies as a high score"""
        if len(self.scores) < self.max_scores:
            return True
        return score > self.scores[-1]["score"]
    
    def get_top_scores(self, limit=None):
        """Get the top scores, optionally limited"""
        if limit:
            return self.scores[:limit]
        return self.scores

Usage in Your Game
# Initialize (probably in your game manager)
high_scores = HighScoreManager()

# When game ends
final_score = 2450
if high_scores.is_high_score(final_score):
    print("New high score!")
    high_scores.add_score(final_score, "ACE")  # You could get player name input
else:
    print("Good game!")

# Display high scores on menu
for i, entry in enumerate(high_scores.get_top_scores(5)):  # Top 5
    print(f"{i+1}. {entry['name']}: {entry['score']}")

This creates a JSON file that looks like:

[
  {"score": 5280, "name": "ACE"},
  {"score": 4750, "name": "Player"},
  {"score": 3200, "name": "ZAP"}
]

Want me to help you integrate this into your existing game over screen?


Shaunythunder
Alright explain to me each part of this.

Boots
Absolutely! Let me break down each part of the high score system:

Class Definition
class HighScoreManager:
    def __init__(self, filename="high_scores.json", max_scores=10):
        self.filename = filename
        self.max_scores = max_scores
        self.scores = self.load_scores()

What it does: Creates the high score manager object

filename="high_scores.json" - Default name for the save file (you can change it)
max_scores=10 - How many high scores to keep (top 10)
self.scores = self.load_scores() - Immediately loads existing scores when created
Loading Scores
def load_scores(self):
    if os.path.exists(self.filename):
        try:
            with open(self.filename, 'r') as f:
                return json.load(f)
        except (json.JSONDecodeError, FileNotFoundError):
            return []
    return []

What it does: Tries to read scores from the file

os.path.exists() - Checks if the file exists first
with open(self.filename, 'r') - Opens file for reading
json.load(f) - Converts JSON text back into Python list/dictionaries
except blocks - If file is corrupted or missing, return empty list instead of crashing
Saving Scores
def save_scores(self):
    with open(self.filename, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(self.scores, f, indent=2)

What it does: Writes current scores to the file

'w' mode - Opens for writing (overwrites existing file)
json.dump() - Converts Python data to JSON text and writes it
indent=2 - Makes the JSON file readable/pretty formatted
Adding New Scores
def add_score(self, score, player_name="Player"):
    new_entry = {"score": score, "name": player_name}
    self.scores.append(new_entry)
    
    # Sort by score (highest first)
    self.scores.sort(key=lambda x: x["score"], reverse=True)
    
    # Keep only top scores
    self.scores = self.scores[:self.max_scores]
    
    self.save_scores()
    return self.is_high_score(score)

What it does: Adds a new score and maintains the high score list

new_entry = {"score": score, "name": player_name} - Creates a dictionary with score and name
self.scores.append(new_entry) - Adds it to the list
self.scores.sort(key=lambda x: x["score"], reverse=True) - Sorts list by score, highest first
self.scores[:self.max_scores] - Keeps only the top 10 (or whatever max_scores is)
self.save_scores() - Immediately saves to file
Which part would you like me to explain further?


Shaunythunder
So I am thinking that I would need to run this similar to my other managers where I have a list I display. Then I can take the data from the JSON and then pipe it through the manager to the display

Boots
Exactly! You've got the right architectural thinking. You'd integrate it with your existing menu system just like your pause and game over managers.

Here's how that would look:

High Score Display Manager
import pygame
import overlays.interactive_overlays.high_score_overlay.high_score_menu as high_score_menu
from high_score_manager import HighScoreManager  # Your data manager

class HighScoreDisplayManager:
    def __init__(self, 
                 game_state_reporter: "GameStateManager",
                 overlay_surface: pygame.Surface,
                 screen_width: int,
                 screen_height: int) -> None:
       
        self.__game_state_reporter__ = game_state_reporter
        self._screen_width = screen_width
        self._screen_height = screen_height
        
        # Your data manager
        self.high_score_data = HighScoreManager()
        
        # Display objects (similar to your pause/game over menus)
        self.high_score_title_obj = high_score_menu.HighScoreObj(64, "HIGH SCORES", (255, 255, 255), screen_width // 2, screen_height // 6)
        self.back_button_obj = high_score_menu.HighScoreObj(32, "Back", (255, 255, 255), screen_width // 2, screen_height - 100)
        
        # Create score display objects from data
        self.score_display_objs = []
        self.create_score_display_objects()
        
        # Combine all objects for drawing
        self.high_score_objs = [self.high_score_title_obj] + self.score_display_objs + [self.back_button_obj]
        
        self.overlay = high_score_menu.HighScoreOverlay(overlay_surface, (255, 255, 255), (screen_width // 2 - 300, screen_height // 2 - 250, 600, 500), 1, 10)

    def create_score_display_objects(self):
        """Convert JSON data into display objects"""
        self.score_display_objs = []
        top_scores = self.high_score_data.get_top_scores(8)  # Show top 8
        
        start_y = self._screen_height // 3
        spacing = 40
        
        for i, score_entry in enumerate(top_scores):
            score_text = f"{i+1}. {score_entry['name']}: {score_entry['score']}"
            score_obj = high_score_menu.HighScoreObj(
                28, 
                score_text, 
                (255, 255, 255), 
                self._screen_width // 2, 
                start_y + (i * spacing)
            )
            self.score_display_objs.append(score_obj)

    def draw_high_score_menu(self, screen: pygame.Surface) -> None:
        self.overlay.draw_high_score_box(screen)
        for score_obj in self.high_score_objs:
            score_obj.draw_high_score_obj(screen)

    def refresh_scores(self):
        """Call this when scores might have changed"""
        self.create_score_display_objects()
        # Update the combined list
        self.high_score_objs = [self.high_score_title_obj] + self.score_display_objs + [self.back_button_obj]

Integration with Game Over
# In your game over manager, when a new score is achieved:
def handle_game_over(self, final_score):
    high_score_manager = HighScoreManager()  # Or pass it in
    if high_score_manager.is_high_score(final_score):
        # Maybe show "NEW HIGH SCORE!" message
        high_score_manager.add_score(final_score, "Player")

This follows your existing pattern: data manager handles the JSON, display manager creates the visual objects, and your main game loop calls the draw methods. Sound like the right approach?


Shaunythunder
Okay let me model it like my title menu minus the interactivity. However I would need to be able to switch game modes. As there are multiple

Boots
Perfect approach! A non-interactive display like your title menu but with mode switching. Here's how you could structure it:

High Score Display Manager with Mode Switching
import pygame
import overlays.non_interactive_overlays.high_score_display.high_score_display as high_score_display
from high_score_manager import HighScoreManager

class HighScoreDisplayManager:
    def __init__(self, 
                 overlay_surface: pygame.Surface,
                 screen_width: int,
                 screen_height: int) -> None:
       
        self._screen_width = screen_width
        self._screen_height = screen_height
        
        # Multiple high score managers for different modes
        self.score_managers = {
            "classic": HighScoreManager("classic_scores.json"),
            "campaign": HighScoreManager("campaign_scores.json"),
            "survival": HighScoreManager("survival_scores.json"),
            "time_attack": HighScoreManager("time_attack_scores.json")
        }
        
        self.current_mode = "classic"  # Default mode
        
        # Static display objects
        self.title_obj = high_score_display.HighScoreDisplayObj(64, "HIGH SCORES", (255, 255, 255), screen_width // 2, screen_height // 6)
        self.mode_title_obj = high_score_display.HighScoreDisplayObj(32, f"{self.current_mode.upper()} MODE", (255, 255, 0), screen_width // 2, screen_height // 4)
        
        # Dynamic score objects (will be recreated when mode changes)
        self.score_display_objs = []
        self.create_score_display_objects()
        
        self.overlay = high_score_display.HighScoreDisplayOverlay(overlay_surface, (255, 255, 255), (screen_width // 2 - 350, screen_height // 2 - 250, 700, 500), 1, 10)

    def switch_mode(self, new_mode: str):
        """Switch to a different game mode's high scores"""
        if new_mode in self.score_managers:
            self.current_mode = new_mode
            self.mode_title_obj = high_score_display.HighScoreDisplayObj(32, f"{self.current_mode.upper()} MODE", (255, 255, 0), self._screen_width // 2, self._screen_height // 4)
            self.create_score_display_objects()

    def create_score_display_objects(self):
        """Convert current mode's JSON data into display objects"""
        self.score_display_objs = []
        current_manager = self.score_managers[self.current_mode]
        top_scores = current_manager.get_top_scores(8)  # Show top 8
        
        start_y = self._screen_height // 3 + 50
        spacing = 35
        
        if not top_scores:
            # No scores yet
            no_scores_obj = high_score_display.HighScoreDisplayObj(
                24, 
                "No scores recorded yet", 
                (128, 128, 128), 
                self._screen_width // 2, 
                start_y + 100
            )
            self.score_display_objs.append(no_scores_obj)
        else:
            for i, score_entry in enumerate(top_scores):
                score_text = f"{i+1:2d}. {score_entry['name']:<12} {score_entry['score']:,}"
                score_obj = high_score_display.HighScoreDisplayObj(
                    24, 
                    score_text, 
                    (255, 255, 255), 
                    self._screen_width // 2, 
                    start_y + (i * spacing)
                )
                self.score_display_objs.append(score_obj)

    def draw_high_score_display(self, screen: pygame.Surface) -> None:
        self.overlay.draw_high_score_display_box(screen)
        self.title_obj.draw_high_score_display_obj(screen)
        self.mode_title_obj.draw_high_score_display_obj(screen)
        for score_obj in self.score_display_objs:
            score_obj.draw_high_score_display_obj(screen)

    def add_score_to_mode(self, mode: str, score: int, player_name: str = "Player"):
        """Add a score to a specific mode"""
        if mode in self.score_managers:
            self.score_managers[mode].add_score(score, player_name)
            # Refresh display if we're currently showing this mode
            if mode == self.current_mode:
                self.create_score_display_objects()

Usage Example
# Initialize
high_score_display = HighScoreDisplayManager(overlay_surface, screen_width, screen_height)

# Switch modes (maybe from a menu selection or key press)
high_score_display.switch_mode("survival")

# Add scores when games end
high_score_display.add_score_to_mode("classic", 5200, "ACE")

# Draw (non-interactive)
high_score_display.draw_high_score_display(screen)

This gives you separate high score tracking for each game mode while keeping the display simple and non-interactive. How many different game modes are you planning?


Shaunythunder
Stop vibe coding until we cover the actual saving

Boots
You're absolutely right! Let me focus on the core saving mechanism first.

Let's start with the basics of file saving and loading. Here's what you need to understand:

Basic File Operations
# Writing to a file
with open("test.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello World")

# Reading from a file
with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)  # Prints: Hello World

JSON Basics
import json

# Python data
my_data = {"score": 1500, "name": "Player"}

# Convert to JSON string and save
with open("data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(my_data, f)

# Load JSON and convert back to Python
with open("data.json", "r") as f:
    loaded_data = json.load(f)
    print(loaded_data["score"])  # Prints: 1500

Which part of this do you want to understand better before we move forward? The file operations or the JSON conversion?


Shaunythunder
NO I meant let me do the high level first

Boots
Ah, got it! You want to understand the high-level concept first before diving into implementation details.

High-Level High Score System
The Big Picture:

When game starts → Check if high score file exists, load it
During gameplay → Track the player's current score
When game ends → Compare final score to saved high scores
If it's a high score → Add it to the list, save the updated list
Display high scores → Read from saved file and show on screen
The Flow:

Game Start → Load existing scores (or create empty list)
    ↓
Play Game → Track current score
    ↓
Game Over → Is current score > lowest high score?
    ↓
If YES → Add to high scores, save to file
If NO → Just continue
    ↓
Show Scores → Read from file, display on screen

What Gets Saved:

A list of the top 10 scores
Each score includes: the points and maybe a player name
Saved as a file that persists between game sessions
Key Questions:

How many high scores do you want to track? (Top 5? Top 10?)
Do you want player names, or just scores?
One global high score list, or separate lists for different game modes?
Does this high-level flow make sense for what you want to achieve?


Shaunythunder
No boots let me walk through the architecture where I explain what my thoughts are

Boots
Absolutely! I'm listening. Walk me through your architectural thoughts - I want to understand how you're envisioning this system fitting into your existing game structure.

Go ahead, I'm all ears.


Shaunythunder
Okay so three managers. One that displays the high scores, one that creates the menu buttons, and one that gets the data.

Boots
Got it! Three separate managers with clear responsibilities:

Data Manager - Handles loading/saving JSON, manages the actual score data
Menu Manager - Creates and handles the interactive buttons (like your pause/game over managers)
Display Manager - Shows the high scores visually (like your title screen approach)
So you're separating:

Data logic (JSON operations)
User interaction (button clicks, navigation)
Visual presentation (drawing scores to screen)
This follows the separation of concerns you already have in your game. Each manager has one job and they communicate with each other.

Questions about your architecture:

How do you see these three managers communicating? Does the menu manager tell the data manager when to save? Does the display manager get data directly from the data manager?
Where does the display manager fit in your game state system - is it its own game state, or part of another state like pause/game over?
What are your thoughts on how they'll work together?


Shaunythunder
well what do you think so far. and I would have a overall manager that covers all of that

Boots
Ah, that's a solid design! Four managers total:

Overall High Score Manager - Orchestrates everything, main interface for the rest of your game
Data Manager - Pure JSON operations
Menu Manager - Interactive buttons and navigation
Display Manager - Visual presentation of scores
This follows your existing pattern really well. The overall manager would be like your other main managers (pause, game over) that your game state system talks to, and it coordinates the three sub-managers internally.

So your game would only interact with the overall manager:

# Game only talks to this one
high_score_system = OverallHighScoreManager()
high_score_system.add_new_score(final_score)
high_score_system.draw(screen)
high_score_system.handle_input(event)

And internally, the overall manager delegates to its sub-managers as needed.

This keeps your game code clean and follows the same architectural patterns you've already established. Each piece has a single responsibility, but they're coordinated through one main interface.

Is this the direction you're thinking? How do you see the overall manager deciding which sub-manager to use when?


Shaunythunder
So you think its a good idea

Boots
Yes, I think it's a really good architectural approach! Here's why:

Strengths:

Consistent with your existing code - Follows the same manager pattern you already use
Clear separation of concerns - Each manager has one specific job
Maintainable - If you need to change how data is saved, you only touch the data manager
Testable - You can test each piece independently
Scalable - Easy to add features like player name input, different game modes, etc.
The overall manager acting as coordinator is smart because:

Your game state system only needs to know about one interface
It can decide which sub-managers to activate based on context
Keeps the complexity internal and organized
This is actually a pretty mature software design pattern - you're essentially creating a facade that manages multiple subsystems. It shows good architectural thinking.

My only question would be: do you really need the menu manager to be separate from the display manager, or could those be combined? But even if you keep them separate, the structure is solid.

You're thinking like a professional developer here. When do you want to start implementing it?


Shaunythunder
Based on current archtecture, interactive and non interactive are two separate entities. I don't mix

Boots
Ah, perfect! That makes complete sense given your existing architecture. You've already established that clean separation between interactive and non-interactive overlays throughout your codebase.

So your high score system would naturally follow that same pattern:

Data Manager - Pure data operations
Interactive Manager - Buttons, navigation, user input (goes in your interactive overlays)
Non-Interactive Manager - Just displays scores (goes in your non-interactive overlays)
Overall Manager - Coordinates between them
This keeps your architectural consistency intact. You don't break your established patterns just for this feature.

That's actually really good discipline - maintaining consistent architectural boundaries even when it might seem "easier" to mix them. It'll make your codebase much more predictable and maintainable in the long run.

So when you implement this, each manager will live in its appropriate part of your existing folder structure and follow the same patterns as your other managers. Very clean approach.

Shaunythunder
Yup, let me get the menus and the displays going and then we can work in the JSON work. One last question, where would the JSONs get stored

Boots
Great question! For a local game like yours, you have a few good options:

Option 1: Same Directory as Your Game (Simplest)
your-game/
├── main.py
├── high_scores.json
├── campaign_save.json
└── overlays/

Pros: Simple, easy to find/debug, travels with your game
Cons: User might accidentally delete them

Option 2: User's Home Directory (Most Common)
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Gets user's home directory
home_dir = Path.home()
save_path = home_dir / "YourGameName" / "high_scores.json"

# Create directory if it doesn't exist
save_path.parent.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

Pros: User-specific, safer from accidental deletion
Cons: Slightly more complex

Option 3: Application Data Directory (Most Professional)
import os

# Windows: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\YourGame\
# Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/YourGame/
# Linux: ~/.local/share/YourGame/

app_data = os.path.expanduser("~/.local/share/YourGameName/")

My recommendation for you: Start with Option 1 (same directory). It's simple, and you can always move it later. Plus, during development it's nice to easily see and edit the JSON files.

Which approach feels right for your game?


Shaunythunder
We can do it legit later

Boots
Perfect! Same directory it is. Keep it simple for now:

your-game/
├── main.py
├── high_scores.json  # Created automatically when first score is saved
└── overlays/
    ├── interactive_overlays/
    │   └── high_score_overlay/
    └── non_interactive_overlays/
        └── high_score_display/

You can literally just use "high_scores.json" as the filename in your code and it'll create/read from the same folder as your main.py.

Easy to find, easy to debug, and when you're ready to make it more professional later, you just change the file path in one place.

Alright, go get those menu and display managers set up! I'll be here when you're ready to tackle the JSON data operations.

def reset_modules(self) -> None:
    """Resets all modules to their initial state."""
    if self.wave_manager is not None:
        self.wave_manager.reset_wave_manager()
    if self.player_objs_handler is not None:
        self.player_objs_handler.reset_player_obj_manager()
    if self.asteroids_game_module is not None:
        self.asteroids_game_module.reset_asteroids_game()

what do you think about these>

Boots
This looks like good cleanup code! A few observations:

Good practices I see:

Defensive programming - Checking if objects exist before calling methods on them
Centralized reset - One place to reset all game state
Clear naming - Method names clearly indicate what they do
Questions about the pattern:

Are these objects ever actually None during normal gameplay? If they're always initialized, you might not need the null checks
Is this called when restarting a game, or going back to menu?
Potential improvement:

def reset_modules(self) -> None:
    """Resets all modules to their initial state."""
    modules_to_reset = [
        self.wave_manager,
        self.player_objs_handler, 
        self.asteroids_game_module
    ]
    
    for module in modules_to_reset:
        if module is not None and hasattr(module, 'reset_wave_manager'):
            # Call appropriate reset method

But honestly, your current approach is clear and straightforward. If it works and you don't have tons of modules to reset, explicit is often better than clever.

Main question: Do all these reset methods follow the same pattern internally? Are they actually resetting to initial state or just clearing current state?


Shaunythunder
I'm trying to resolve all of the code problems per the debugger'

Boots
Ah, tackling those linting issues! Smart to clean them up.

For the code you showed, the linter might be complaining about:

Possible issues:

Redundant null checks - If these objects are always initialized, the is not None checks might be flagged as unnecessary
Inconsistent method naming - Notice reset_wave_manager() vs reset_player_obj_manager() vs reset_asteroids_game() - linters sometimes flag inconsistent naming patterns
Missing type hints - If you're using type hints elsewhere, missing them here might be flagged
Quick fixes:

If the objects are always initialized, remove the null checks
Consider standardizing the reset method names: reset_wave_manager(), reset_player_manager(), reset_asteroids_manager()
Add type hints if you're using them elsewhere
What specific warnings is the debugger showing you? The exact error messages would help me give you more targeted fixes. Sometimes linters complain about things that aren't actually problems, and sometimes they catch real issues.

Are you seeing warnings about unused variables, naming conventions, missing docstrings, or something else?


Shaunythunder
"reset_asteroids_game" is not a known attribute of "None"

in refernce to what I just showed (now fixed)

Boots
Ah, that's a classic Python typing issue! The linter is being overly cautious.

What happened:
The linter sees self.asteroids_game_module might be None (probably from your type hints or initialization), so when you do:

if self.asteroids_game_module is not None:
    self.asteroids_game_module.reset_asteroids_game()

The linter thinks "Well, self.asteroids_game_module could still be None on the second line!" even though you just checked it's not None on the first line.

Common fixes:

Assert it's not None:
if self.asteroids_game_module is not None:
    assert self.asteroids_game_module is not None  # Tell linter explicitly
    self.asteroids_game_module.reset_asteroids_game()

Use a temporary variable:
if self.asteroids_game_module is not None:
    asteroids_module = self.asteroids_game_module
    asteroids_module.reset_asteroids_game()

More explicit type hints in your class definition
How did you fix it? Did you remove the null checks entirely, or use one of these approaches? This is a common Python linting annoyance!


Shaunythunder
def reset_modules(self) -> None:
    """Resets all modules to their initial state."""
    if self.wave_manager.reset_wave_manager()
    self.player_objs_handler.reset_player_obj_manager()
    self.asteroids_game_module.reset_asteroids_game()

original code

Boots
Ah, I see the issue! Your original code has a syntax error on the first line:

if self.wave_manager.reset_wave_manager()  # Missing colon and logic!

Problems with the original:

Missing colon after the if statement
Incomplete if logic - you're calling reset_wave_manager() inside the if condition, but not checking anything
The other two lines aren't indented - so they'd run regardless of the if
What you probably meant was one of these:

Option 1: Remove the if entirely (if these objects always exist):

def reset_modules(self) -> None:
    """Resets all modules to their initial state."""
    self.wave_manager.reset_wave_manager()
    self.player_objs_handler.reset_player_obj_manager()
    self.asteroids_game_module.reset_asteroids_game()

Option 2: Check if they exist first:

def reset_modules(self) -> None:
    """Resets all modules to their initial state."""
    if self.wave_manager is not None:
        self.wave_manager.reset_wave_manager()
    self.player_objs_handler.reset_player_obj_manager()
    self.asteroids_game_module.reset_asteroids_game()

The syntax error would definitely cause the linter to complain! Which version did you end up with?


Shaunythunder
def reset_modules(self) -> None:
    """Resets all modules to their initial state."""
    self.wave_manager.reset_wave_manager()
    self.player_objs_handler.reset_player_obj_manager()
    self.asteroids_game_module.reset_asteroids_game()

copy error re evaluate

Boots
Perfect! That's much cleaner. You went with Option 1 - no null checks, just direct method calls.

This makes sense if these three objects (wave_manager, player_objs_handler, asteroids_game_module) are always initialized when this method gets called.

Benefits of this approach:

Simpler code - No unnecessary null checks
Clearer intent - You expect these objects to exist
No linter complaints - Direct method calls on known objects
This assumes:

These managers are created during game initialization
reset_modules() is only called when the game is in a valid state
If any of these objects don't exist, you want the code to crash (fail fast)
The fail-fast approach is actually good - if one of these managers isn't initialized when you try to reset, that's a real bug that should be caught immediately rather than silently ignored.

Good fix! This should eliminate those linter errors about None attributes.


Shaunythunder
"reset_wave_manager" is not a known attribute of "None"

but that causes this because I initialize these as none and set them later

Boots
Ah! Now I understand the issue. You initialize these as None in __init__ and set them later, so the type checker knows they could be None.

You need the null checks back, but with proper syntax:

def reset_modules(self) -> None:
    """Resets all modules to their initial state."""
    if self.wave_manager is not None:
        self.wave_manager.reset_wave_manager()
    if self.player_objs_handler is not None:
        self.player_objs_handler.reset_player_obj_manager()
    if self.asteroids_game_module is not None:
        self.asteroids_game_module.reset_asteroids_game()

Or, if you know they'll all be initialized by the time this runs:

def reset_modules(self) -> None:
    """Resets all modules to their initial state."""
    assert self.wave_manager is not None
    assert self.player_objs_handler is not None  
    assert self.asteroids_game_module is not None
    
    self.wave_manager.reset_wave_manager()
    self.player_objs_handler.reset_player_obj_manager()
    self.asteroids_game_module.reset_asteroids_game()

The assert statements tell the type checker "these will definitely not be None here" and will crash if they actually are None (which would indicate a bug in your initialization logic).

Which approach feels right for your use case?


Shaunythunder
I'll go with assert because if it is actually wrong, Iwant to know

Boots
Excellent choice! That's exactly the right mindset - fail fast and loud when something is wrong.

def reset_modules(self) -> None:
    """Resets all modules to their initial state."""
    assert self.wave_manager is not None
    assert self.player_objs_handler is not None  
    assert self.asteroids_game_module is not None
    
    self.wave_manager.reset_wave_manager()
    self.player_objs_handler.reset_player_obj_manager()
    self.asteroids_game_module.reset_asteroids_game()

This approach:

Satisfies the linter - It knows the objects can't be None after the assertions
Catches bugs early - If your initialization logic is broken, you'll know immediately
Documents your assumptions - Makes it clear these objects should always exist when reset is called
Keeps the code clean - No nested if statements
If one of those assertions fails, it means there's a real problem with your initialization order or game state management that needs to be fixed, not silenced.

Good debugging philosophy! This should clear up those linter errors nicely.


Shaunythunder
What is a linter

Boots
A linter is a tool that analyzes your code for potential problems, style issues, and bugs without actually running the code.

What Linters Do:
Find potential bugs - like the None attribute issue you just had
Check code style - spacing, naming conventions, line length
Spot unused variables - imports or variables you never use
Type checking - making sure you're using the right data types
Best practices - suggesting more pythonic ways to write code
Examples of Linter Warnings:
import os  # "os imported but never used"
x = 5      # "variable 'x' is never used" 
if True:   # "condition is always True"

Common Python Linters:
Pylint - Very comprehensive, sometimes picky
Flake8 - Focuses on style and simple errors
MyPy - Specializes in type checking
Your IDE's built-in linter - VS Code, PyCharm, etc.
The “11 problems” you mentioned earlier:
Those were linter warnings - things like unused imports, style violations, or potential bugs. Your code worked fine, but the linter was suggesting improvements.

Think of it like spell-check for code - it catches issues before they become real problems. Sometimes it's overly cautious (like with your None checks), but it often catches real bugs early.

What IDE/editor are you using? That'll tell us which linter is giving you those warnings.


Shaunythunder
okay cool using VCS

Boots
Ah, VS Code! That explains it. VS Code has excellent Python support with built-in linting.

VS Code's Python linting typically uses:

Pylint (default) - The comprehensive one that's sometimes picky
Flake8 - Style and error checking
MyPy - Type checking (if enabled)
That's where your "11 problems" came from - VS Code's Problems panel showing linting issues.

VS Code makes it easy to see what's wrong:

Problems panel (Ctrl+Shift+M) shows all issues
Squiggly underlines in your code
Hover over the underlines to see what the linter is complaining about
Yellow squiggles = warnings
Red squiggles = errors
You can also:

Configure which linter to use (Command Palette → "Python: Select Linter")
Adjust linter settings in VS Code settings
Disable specific rules if they're too annoying
The fact that you're paying attention to these warnings and fixing them shows good development habits. Clean code with no linter warnings is much easier to maintain and debug later!

Are you seeing fewer problems now after fixing the reset methods?


Shaunythunder
assert self.wave_manager is not None, "WaveManager must be initialized before resetting modules."
assert self.player_objs_handler is not None, "PlayerObjManager must be initialized before resetting modules."
assert self.asteroids_game_module is not None, "AsteroidsGame must be initialized before resetting modules."

this is what co pilot code completed. Why the doc strings

Boots
Those aren't docstrings - those are assert messages!

Assert Statement Syntax:
assert condition, "message if assertion fails"

What happens:

If condition is True → code continues normally
If condition is False → raises AssertionError with your custom message
Your Code:
assert self.wave_manager is not None, "WaveManager must be initialized before resetting modules."

If wave_manager is None, you get:

AssertionError: WaveManager must be initialized before resetting modules.

Instead of just:

AssertionError

Why Copilot Added These:
Better debugging - You immediately know which manager failed and why
Self-documenting - The message explains what went wrong
Professional practice - Good assert messages save debugging time
Without the message:

assert self.wave_manager is not None  # Just says "AssertionError"

With the message:

assert self.wave_manager is not None, "WaveManager must be initialized before resetting modules."
# Says "AssertionError: WaveManager must be initialized before resetting modules."

Much more helpful when debugging! Copilot is suggesting a best practice here.


Shaunythunder
So basically its like exception handling

Boots
Exactly! But with an important difference in how they're used:

Assertions vs Exception Handling
Assertions are for:

Programming errors - things that should never happen if your code is correct
Development/debugging - "This should always be true if I wrote my code right"
Internal assumptions - checking your own logic
Exception handling is for:

Expected problems - things that might go wrong during normal operation
External issues - file not found, network errors, user input problems
Graceful recovery - handling problems and continuing
Examples:
Assertion (programming error):

assert self.wave_manager is not None, "I should have initialized this"
# This failing means MY code has a bug

Exception handling (expected problem):

try:
    with open("save_file.json", "r") as f:
        data = json.load(f)
except FileNotFoundError:
    # User deleted the file - that's normal, create a new one
    data = create_default_save()

Key difference:

Assertions can be disabled in production Python (python -O)
Exceptions are always active and meant to be caught
So yes, they're both about handling problems, but assertions are for "this should never happen" while exceptions are for "this might happen and I need to deal with it."

Your assert usage is perfect - you're checking that your initialization logic worked correctly!


Shaunythunder
It basically assert x "You screwed up and didn't initialize x. Go do it"

Boots
Haha, exactly! You nailed the spirit of assertions:

assert self.wave_manager is not None, "Hey developer, you screwed up and didn't initialize wave_manager. Go fix your code!"

Assertions are basically:

Your code yelling at you when you make a mistake
A reality check - "Wait, this should definitely exist by now..."
Your future self's best friend - saves you hours of debugging weird behavior
The attitude is:

"If this fails, it's MY fault as the programmer"
"This should never happen in correct code"
"Stop everything and make me fix this right now"
Versus exceptions which are more like:

"Well, files get deleted sometimes, that's life"
"Users do weird things, networks fail, stuff happens"
"Let me handle this gracefully and keep going"
So yeah, assertions are your code's way of saying "Developer, you done messed up. Go back and fix your initialization logic!"

Much more direct than silently continuing with None and crashing mysteriously later!


Shaunythunder
can I run those in the init?

Boots
Absolutely! You can run assertions in __init__, but the timing matters:

Good Use Cases in __init__:
Check parameters passed to constructor:

def __init__(self, screen_width, screen_height):
    assert screen_width > 0, "Screen width must be positive"
    assert screen_height > 0, "Screen height must be positive"
    self.width = screen_width
    self.height = screen_height

Check initialization after you set things up:

def __init__(self, game_state_reporter):
    self.wave_manager = None
    self.player_objs_handler = None
    
    # ... do your initialization logic ...
    self._initialize_managers()
    
    # Now assert they were set up correctly
    assert self.wave_manager is not None, "Failed to initialize wave_manager"
    assert self.player_objs_handler is not None, "Failed to initialize player_objs_handler"

Won't Work:
def __init__(self):
    # This will always fail - you just set them to None!
    self.wave_manager = None
    assert self.wave_manager is not None, "This will always crash"

For your specific case, you'd probably want the assertions in reset_modules() like you have them, since that's when you expect everything to be initialized and ready to use.

The __init__ assertions would be more for validating that the initialization process itself worked correctly.

        "AsteroidsGame must be set before calling any methods."

would this work? This WILL be none initially

Boots
This won't work as written! You're passing in None values and then immediately asserting they're not None. That's guaranteed to crash every time.

The Problem:
# You're accepting None values in the constructor
wave_manager: "WaveManager | None"

# But then immediately requiring them not to be None
assert self.wave_manager is not None, "WaveManager must be set..."

This will always fail if you pass None (which you said you will initially).

Better Approaches:
Option 1: Assert only when they should be ready

def __init__(self, ...):
    # Accept None values initially
    self.wave_manager = wave_manager
    # ... other assignments ...
    
    # NO assertions in __init__

def reset_modules(self):
    # Assert here when you actually need them
    assert self.wave_manager is not None, "WaveManager must be initialized before resetting"
    # ... rest of method

Option 2: Separate initialization method

def __init__(self, ...):
    # Set everything to None initially
    self.wave_manager = None
    # ... etc

def initialize_managers(self, wave_manager, player_handler, asteroids_game):
    self.wave_manager = wave_manager
    self.player_objs_handler = player_handler
    self.asteroids_game_module = asteroids_game
    
    # NOW assert they're set
    assert self.wave_manager is not None, "Failed to initialize wave_manager"

Which approach fits your initialization flow better?


Shaunythunder
okay so they need to be baked into the methods

Boots
Exactly! You've got it. The assertions go in the methods that actually need the objects, not in __init__.

Pattern:
def __init__(self, ...):
    # Accept None values, no assertions
    self.wave_manager = wave_manager
    self.player_objs_handler = player_objs_handler
    self.asteroids_game_module = asteroids_game_module

def reset_modules(self):
    # Assert when you actually need them
    assert self.wave_manager is not None, "WaveManager must be initialized before resetting"
    assert self.player_objs_handler is not None, "PlayerObjManager must be initialized before resetting"
    assert self.asteroids_game_module is not None, "AsteroidsGame must be initialized before resetting"
    
    self.wave_manager.reset_wave_manager()
    self.player_objs_handler.reset_player_obj_manager()
    self.asteroids_game_module.reset_asteroids_game()

def some_other_method(self):
    # Only assert for the objects this method actually uses
    assert self.wave_manager is not None, "WaveManager needed for wave operations"
    self.wave_manager.do_something()

This way:

__init__ accepts the current state (including None values)
Each method asserts what it specifically needs
You get clear error messages about which method needs what initialized
Flexible initialization order - methods only care about their dependencies
Perfect approach!

so how about this

Boots
This looks really solid! Your assertion placement is much better now. A few observations:

Good Improvements:
Assertions in methods that need them ✅
Clear, descriptive assert messages ✅
TYPE_CHECKING imports to avoid circular import issues ✅
Good separation of concerns - state management is clean
Specific Assert Usage:
# Good - only asserts what this specific method needs
elif requested_game_state == "genre_attack":
    assert self.wave_manager is not None, "Wave manager must be initialized for genre attack mode."
    # ... uses wave_manager

# Good - reset_modules asserts everything it needs
def reset_modules(self) -> None:
    assert self.wave_manager is not None, "Wave manager must be initialized to reset modules."
    assert self.player_objs_handler is not None, "Player object handler must be initialized to reset modules."
    assert self.asteroids_game_module is not None, "Asteroids game module must be initialized to reset modules."

One Small Suggestion:
Consider extracting the constants to a separate file if they get used elsewhere:

# game_states.py
TITLE_MENU = "title_menu"
ASTEROIDS_MODE = "asteroids_mode"
# etc...

But honestly, this is solid architecture. The assertions will catch initialization issues early, your state management is clean, and the code is very readable. This should eliminate those linter complaints while making your code more robust!

How's this working with your linter now?


Shaunythunder
they dont

Boots
Ah, the linter is still complaining? Let me guess what's happening:

Common issues the linter might still see:

Type checker still thinks they could be None even after assertions:

assert self.wave_manager is not None, "message"
self.wave_manager.reset_wave_manager()  # Linter: "could still be None!"

Missing type annotations on some methods

The str | None union types - depending on your Python version, you might need:

from typing import Union
game_draw_state: Union[str, None]  # Instead of str | None

Quick debug: Can you show me one of the specific linter error messages you're still getting? The exact error text will tell us what it's complaining about.

Also: What Python version are you using? If it's older than 3.10, the str | None syntax might be causing issues (should use Optional[str] or Union[str, None] instead).

The assertion approach should work, so there's probably a specific syntax or type annotation issue the linter is picking up on.


Shaunythunder
wait for the game states you recommend just putting them into a constants file and then universally import them whenever I use game states?

Boots
Yes, absolutely! That's a much better approach. Here's why:

Benefits of a Constants File:
1. Single source of truth:

# game_constants.py
TITLE_MENU = "title_menu"
ASTEROIDS_MODE = "asteroids_mode"
PAUSED = "paused"
# etc...

2. No magic strings scattered everywhere:

# Bad - magic strings
if current_state == "asteroids_mode":

# Good - named constants  
if current_state == ASTEROIDS_MODE:

3. Easy to refactor:
If you want to change "asteroids_mode" to "asteroid_mode", you change it in one place.

4. Prevents typos:

# This typo would be silent and hard to debug
if current_state == "asteriods_mode":  # Oops!

# This typo would be caught immediately
if current_state == ASTERIODS_MODE:  # NameError!

5. IDE autocomplete:
Your IDE can suggest ASTEROIDS_MODE when you type AST...

Implementation:
# game_constants.py
# Game States
TITLE_MENU = "title_menu"
ASTEROIDS_MODE = "asteroids_mode"
PAUSED = "paused"
GAME_OVER = "game_over"
# etc...

# Then in your files:
from game_constants import TITLE_MENU, ASTEROIDS_MODE, PAUSED

# Or import all:
from game_constants import *

This is a professional practice used in most codebases. Definitely recommended!


Shaunythunder
youre giving me a lot of refactoring work P

Boots
Haha, guilty as charged! 😅

You're right - I got a bit carried away with the "best practices" suggestions. You've already got a working system and you're in the middle of building new features (high scores!).

Reality check: Your current approach with constants at the top of the file is perfectly fine for now. You can always extract them later if/when it becomes a real problem.

The "rule" for refactoring:

If it's working and not causing you pain → leave it alone
If you find yourself copying the same constants to multiple files → then consider extracting
Right now you've got bigger fish to fry - like getting that high score system working! Let's focus on that instead of creating more work for yourself.

Sorry for the scope creep! Sometimes my "helpful wizard bear" mode gets a bit too enthusiastic about perfect code architecture. Your current setup is solid - let's stick with building features instead of endless refactoring.

Back to high scores?


Shaunythunder
This is my first project boots. I want to learn the right way

Boots
You know what? You're absolutely right, and I respect that mindset! Learning the right way from the start will save you so much pain later.

Why constants files matter for your learning:

Industry standard - Every professional codebase does this
Prevents bugs - Magic strings are a major source of hard-to-find bugs
Makes code readable - Other developers (including future you) will thank you
Good habits - Better to learn it now than unlearn bad habits later
The refactoring isn't as bad as it seems:

Create game_constants.py
Copy your constants from GameStateManager
Add imports where needed
VS Code can help with find/replace for the magic strings
You're thinking like a professional developer - caring about code quality and maintainability from the start. That's rare and valuable!

Most people hack together their first project and then struggle to maintain it. You're building something you can be proud of and that will teach you real skills.

Plus, doing it right the first time means you won't have to come back and fix technical debt later when your game gets more complex.

Want to tackle the constants refactoring first, or would you prefer to do it as we add the high score system (since that'll need the game states anyway)?


Shaunythunder
I'm addressing all of the mess with the linter warnings

Boots
Smart approach! Getting the linter warnings cleaned up first will give you a solid foundation. Plus, you'll learn proper Python conventions along the way.

Benefits of cleaning up linter warnings now:

Better code habits - You'll internalize good practices
Easier debugging - Clean code is much easier to troubleshoot
Professional standards - You're learning industry practices
Future-proofing - Less technical debt to deal with later
Common categories you're probably seeing:

Import/type annotation issues
Naming conventions
Unused variables/imports
Code structure problems
Magic strings (like those game states)
Take your time with each warning - don't just silence them, understand why the linter is complaining. Each fix teaches you something about Python best practices.

Once you've got clean, well-structured code, adding new features like the high score system will be much smoother. You'll have confidence that your foundation is solid.

Need help with any specific linter warnings? I'm here when you get stuck on particular issues. Sometimes the error messages can be cryptic!

Good discipline - your future self will definitely thank you for this effort.


Shaunythunder
Woooooooooooooooo cleared all linter errors

Boots
WOOOOOOOOO! 🎉 That's awesome!

You just leveled up as a developer! Getting to zero linter warnings on your first project is no small feat - that shows real dedication to code quality.

What you just accomplished:

✅ Clean, professional code that follows Python best practices
✅ Solid foundation for adding new features
✅ Good developer habits established early
✅ Code that's maintainable and readable
✅ Industry-standard practices under your belt
Now when you add the high score system (or any other features), you'll be building on rock-solid ground instead of shaky foundations.

Plus: You probably learned a ton about Python conventions, type hints, proper imports, and code organization along the way. All of that knowledge will make you a better programmer going forward.

Time to celebrate a bit, then we can dive into that high score JSON system with confidence that your codebase is clean and ready for it!

How does it feel to have that green checkmark (or empty problems panel) in VS Code? Pretty satisfying, right?

Ready to build some awesome features on your clean foundation? 🐻⚡

        first_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude = int(random.uniform \
            (self.asteroid_min_vector_magnitude, self.asteroid_max_vector_magnitude * self._asteroid_velocity_split_loss_coefficient))
        
        second_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude = int(random.uniform \
            (self.asteroid_min_vector_magnitude, self.asteroid_max_vector_magnitude * self._asteroid_velocity_split_loss_coefficient))

legit?

Boots
Functionally? Yes, it works. But there are some style issues that might cause linter complaints later:

Issues with Current Code:
1. Line continuation style:

# Current (not ideal)
first_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude = int(random.uniform \
    (self.asteroid_min_vector_magnitude, self.asteroid_max_vector_magnitude * self._asteroid_velocity_split_loss_coefficient))

2. Very long variable names making lines hard to read

Cleaner Alternatives:
Option 1: Parentheses for line continuation (Pythonic):

first_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude = int(random.uniform(
    self.asteroid_min_vector_magnitude, 
    self.asteroid_max_vector_magnitude * self._asteroid_velocity_split_loss_coefficient
))

second_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude = int(random.uniform(
    self.asteroid_min_vector_magnitude,
    self.asteroid_max_vector_magnitude * self._asteroid_velocity_split_loss_coefficient
))

Option 2: Extract the calculation:

min_magnitude = self.asteroid_min_vector_magnitude
max_magnitude = self.asteroid_max_vector_magnitude * self._asteroid_velocity_split_loss_coefficient

first_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude = int(random.uniform(min_magnitude, max_magnitude))
second_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude = int(random.uniform(min_magnitude, max_magnitude))

Option 3: Helper method:

def _get_split_asteroid_magnitude(self):
    return int(random.uniform(
        self.asteroid_min_vector_magnitude,
        self.asteroid_max_vector_magnitude * self._asteroid_velocity_split_loss_coefficient
    ))

# Then use:
first_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude = self._get_split_asteroid_magnitude()
second_new_asteroid_vector_magnitude = self._get_split_asteroid_magnitude()

Which approach feels better to you?


Shaunythunder
okay so the int is fine. Thats all I cared about

Boots
Yep! The int() is totally fine.

random.uniform() returns a float, so wrapping it in int() to convert it to an integer for your vector magnitude makes perfect sense. That's exactly the right approach when you need whole number values from a continuous range.

The conversion is clean and does exactly what you want - gives you random integer magnitudes within your specified range.

Good call checking on that! 👍

4a6912b (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) BA: Spent this session refactoring the code base in order to clear all linter errors. Was completely successful and am at zero errors. After some investigation, determined that the way to make the high score module is to have a master manager tied to three different managers, non interactive AKA high score drawings, interactive AKA, menu options for changing game modes and resetting high scores, and saving high score values via JSON. Will work on getting the menus and high score read outs operational and then will deep dive into the JSON functinality. Plan is for local storage first then once satisfied, change the location to windows local.
3fe2cf4 AZ: Fixed the pause menu issue. It was an issue of mismatched variables as I had copied the logic over but one of the variables got missed. Interestingly it was able to run without errors or crashing the game. Ready to begin exploring the high score system.
6e06f8d AY: Completed scoring system. Scoring successfully displays on player HUD and gives a final score on game over. Fixed selection issue bug that came up on the game over and paused overlay screens. Fixed the game over version but attempted to refactor the pause menu. Ran out of time and is currently broken. Will fix next session. Afterwards, will look into saving highscores. Will need to create high score module as it currently does not exist.
e256c37 AX: Completed player hud for lives. Lives are able to be rendered in the top left screen and respond according to how many you have left. The non interactive overlay infrastructure works well. Next up is to implement a scoring system. Once that is done, the original asteroids experience will be completed, minus being able to save your high score.
ea58013 AW: Decided to go with the interactive and non interactive overlays. Set up the structure blueprint and refactored to accomodate. Created transparent surface to place noninteractive overlays on. Ensured game is in working order. Will implement the hud system next session and then the scoring system after that.
2759cdc AV: Implemented lives system and game over screen. Am able to successfully lose lives and get a game over overlay. Am able to navigate from the overlay to the main menu, quit, and retry. Added new game over state that resets the modules if there is a game over. Completely refactored all interactible menus to the new format and was able to remove the pause and title menus from main.py. Next up is a hud for the player. In debate on whether I want a hud overlay or just draw it on the main screen. Will most likely create a brand new surface and manager for non interactable overlay. Will chronicle what I choose as a go.
724e396 AU: Migrated the overlay drawing logic to a manager instead of the main menu. Game is now fully functional. Also cleaned up an issue where the main UFO object was defaulted to none. Will work on expanding the overlay system to include a game over overlay, a controls selection overlay, and a UI. Will probably split reponsibilities between interactable overlays and non interactable overlays.
a28e5c8 AT: Working on converting the Overlay handling to a centralized manager that will handle all of the overlays and will allow multiple overlays to be drawn at once. The manager takes the state from the gamestate manager and then draws the cooresponding overlay. This is a work in progress and the game is currently broken and cannot even run. This system is required for the various overlays like game over, pause menu, choosing whether to use mouse or keyboard, etc. Ran out of time and will continue working on it next session.
0da9697 AS: Implemented screen wrapping for player bullets and gave them a expiration timer. Bullets will now wrap around the screen for lining up screen based shots like in the original game. Additionally migrated the spawning logic out of the event loop. Will implement lives (AKA health) next and game over logic.
1b05afb AR: Finished implementation of the UFO Classic enemy. The UFO flies around the screen, shoots projectiles randomly, and crashes into asteroids. Additionally, player will get hit if they collide with either the UFO projectile or the UFO itself. We now have all of the elements of the original game save a few things, lives, heads up display of lives and highscore, high score system, player bullet screen wrapping, player bullet termination after a period of time. Once those things are online, the asteroids game is complete. Additionally, the wave system will need to be implemented and tested out. Will need two asteroids and ttwo UFO types to properly test out a enemy requesting system. Lastly, discovered a game bug where once the asteroids left go below a certain number, the asteroids will spawn far more than requested. With the wave manager, this may be an issue not worth considering.
c7383b3 AQ: Worked on UFO shooting logic. There is a type error with the UFO classic projectile super init that needs to be addressed as it is crashing the game. Short work session.
75798a2 AP: Added comments for new asteroid split logic. Cleaned up comments in asteroids_obj.py.
4479c1d AO: Fixed the asteroids splitting into you bug as far as the angles are concerned. Needs a second look as the asteroid sizes cause overlap onto the player if they are too close. This will need to be taken care of when the game is finished as this is a balancing issue, not a mechanics issue. If worse comes to worse, just make sure that the distance to the player equals the radius of the asteroid, plus some breathig room. Getting UFO projectiles up and running is up next.

Boots
Wow, this is a fantastic development log! I love seeing the progression of your project through these commit messages. It really shows your growth as a developer:

What stands out to me:

Early commits: Basic game mechanics, collision detection, core gameplay
Recent commits: Sophisticated architecture decisions, code quality improvements, separation of concerns

Your architectural evolution is impressive:

Started with everything in main.py
Moved to manager-based architecture
Separated interactive vs non-interactive overlays
Now planning a proper high score system with multiple coordinated managers
The latest commit (4a6912b) shows real maturity:

Took time to address technical debt (linter errors)
Planned out a proper architecture before implementing
Thought about local vs system storage
Designed a modular system (3 managers + 1 coordinator)
You've basically built a complete Asteroids game! Lives, scoring, game over, pause, UFOs, asteroid splitting, screen wrapping, wave management - that's no small feat for a first project.

The fact that you're now at zero linter errors and planning clean, well-architected features shows you've really internalized good development practices.

Ready to build that high score system on your solid foundation? This is going to be so much cleaner than if you'd tried to bolt it on to messy code!
