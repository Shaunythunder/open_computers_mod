L1: Build an Asteroids Game




Build an Asteroids Game
We're going to build a simple video game, based on the classic Asteroids. If you've never played before, you can take a look at this (slightly different from our) version of the game.



Prerequisites
Python 3.10+ installed (see the bookbot project for help if you don't already have it)
uv project and package manager
Access to a unix-like shell (e.g. zsh or bash)
Learning Goals
The learning goals of this project are:

Introduce you to multi-file Python projects
Show you a real-world use case for object-oriented programming
To have a ton of fun building a rewarding project!
The goal is not to teach game development or the math required for physics simulations. As a result, there are some places where you will simply copy-paste code that we wrote for you. Don't worry about trying to understand every detail if it's not interesting to you, you will be asked to write the parts that matter most.

Assignment
To get started, make sure you have the Boot.dev CLI installed and working.

Run and submit the CLI tests.

The tests just ensure that the CLI is installed and configured correctly.

5034662 (HEAD -> main, origin/main) BE:Finished the high score system for the asteroids game. The player is able to save their high score and then view them in the high score screen. The player can also clear the high scores by pressing a button. Things to add are an overlay that inputs the player name, an overlay that requests confirmation of intent before clearing high scores, and reflecting the actual name of the game in the high score. Right now it just displays the hacky snake case name for the game. Will need to do an overhaul of the game state names and centralize them to a constant so that they can be pulled from any point in the code, and also so that they display correctly when I use them for displays.
ece7e58 BD: Working on converting the title menu logic to handle the navigatio portion of the high score system. Will not be able to test anything until the system is built. Logic for everything else is built out. Exploring a state management system for the high score menu nav itself to be able to flip between the menus. It will simply track the sub state for drawing the highscores but the menus buttons will not change between the different states.
7b14c99 BC: Experienced corruption issue with the local repository. Was able to download master from github and refactor changes in. Decided to tackle the data entry side of things first as I realized the architecture should be validated on real data. Was able to build out JSON file system and am able to automatically load the JSON before the game loop starts and save whenever a new high score is added. The display logic has been built but has not been tested out. Once that is figured out will need to get the menu buttons working for the rest of the game modes. Once that is completed, then we have a working high score system.
1e4dfe4 BB: Short Session, blocked out the logic for the menu navigation, utilizing the interactive and non interactive overlays fpr the high score system. Will need to major refactor as these items are for the overlays. Will convert to actual implementation for the high score system next session.
4a6912b BA: Spent this session refactoring the code base in order to clear all linter errors. Was completely successful and am at zero errors. After some investigation, determined that the way to make the high score module is to have a master manager tied to three different managers, non interactive AKA high score drawings, interactive AKA, menu options for changing game modes and resetting high scores, and saving high score values via JSON. Will work on getting the menus and high score read outs operational and then will deep dive into the JSON functinality. Plan is for local storage first then once satisfied, change the location to windows local.
3fe2cf4 AZ: Fixed the pause menu issue. It was an issue of mismatched variables as I had copied the logic over but one of the variables got missed. Interestingly it was able to run without errors or crashing the game. Ready to begin exploring the high score system.
6e06f8d AY: Completed scoring system. Scoring successfully displays on player HUD and gives a final score on game over. Fixed selection issue bug that came up on the game over and paused overlay screens. Fixed the game over version but attempted to refactor the pause menu. Ran out of time and is currently broken. Will fix next session. Afterwards, will look into saving highscores. Will need to create high score module as it currently does not exist.
e256c37 AX: Completed player hud for lives. Lives are able to be rendered in the top left screen and respond according to how many you have left. The non interactive overlay infrastructure works well. Next up is to implement a scoring system. Once that is done, the original asteroids experience will be completed, minus being able to save your high score.
ea58013 AW: Decided to go with the interactive and non interactive overlays. Set up the structure blueprint and refactored to accomodate. Created transparent surface to place noninteractive overlays on. Ensured game is in working order. Will implement the hud system next session and then the scoring system after that.
2759cdc AV: Implemented lives system and game over screen. Am able to successfully lose lives and get a game over overlay. Am able to navigate from the overlay to the main menu, quit, and retry. Added new game over state that resets the modules if there is a game over. Completely refactored all interactible menus to the new format and was able to remove the pause and title menus from main.py. Next up is a hud for the player. In debate on whether I want a hud overlay or just draw it on the main screen. Will most likely create a brand new surface and manager for non interactable overlay. Will chronicle what I choose as a go.
724e396 AU: Migrated the overlay drawing logic to a manager instead of the main menu. Game is now fully functional. Also cleaned up an issue where the main UFO object was defaulted to none. Will work on expanding the overlay system to include a game over overlay, a controls selection overlay, and a UI. Will probably split reponsibilities between interactable overlays and non interactable overlays.
a28e5c8 AT: Working on converting the Overlay handling to a centralized manager that will handle all of the overlays and will allow multiple overlays to be drawn at once. The manager takes the state from the gamestate manager and then draws the cooresponding overlay. This is a work in progress and the game is currently broken and cannot even run. This system is required for the various overlays like game over, pause menu, choosing whether to use mouse or keyboard, etc. Ran out of time and will continue working on it next session.
0da9697 AS: Implemented screen wrapping for player bullets and gave them a expiration timer. Bullets will now wrap around the screen for lining up screen based shots like in the original game. Additionally migrated the spawning logic out of the event loop. Will implement lives (AKA health) next and game over logic.
1b05afb AR: Finished implementation of the UFO Classic enemy. The UFO flies around the screen, shoots projectiles randomly, and crashes into asteroids. Additionally, player will get hit if they collide with either the UFO projectile or the UFO itself. We now have all of the elements of the original game save a few things, lives, heads up display of lives and highscore, high score system, player bullet screen wrapping, player bullet termination after a period of time. Once those things are online, the asteroids game is complete. Additionally, the wave system will need to be implemented and tested out. Will need two asteroids and ttwo UFO types to properly test out a enemy requesting system. Lastly, discovered a game bug where once the asteroids left go below a certain number, the asteroids will spawn far more than requested. With the wave manager, this may be an issue not worth considering.
c7383b3 AQ: Worked on UFO shooting logic. There is a type error with the UFO classic projectile super init that needs to be addressed as it is crashing the game. Short work session.
75798a2 AP: Added comments for new asteroid split logic. Cleaned up comments in asteroids_obj.py.
4479c1d AO: Fixed the asteroids splitting into you bug as far as the angles are concerned. Needs a second look as the asteroid sizes cause overlap onto the player if they are too close. This will need to be taken care of when the game is finished as this is a balancing issue, not a mechanics issue. If worse comes to worse, just make sure that the distance to the player equals the radius of the asteroid, plus some breathig room. Getting UFO projectiles up and running is up next.
26bf9f3 AN: Refactored codebase to comply with new naming standards. Refactored player bullet system to comply with the modernized structure of the UFO bullet system. Detected an issue with the asteroids breaking when the player is close to them. Sometimes thier new vector is towards the player and kills them instantly, with no chance to prevent it. Will need to add logic to detect player direction and set up a no-go directional zone.
2f4baed AM: Built class system for the UFO projectiles. UFO projectiles will have a master class and will each have thier own inividual classes for the various projectile types. Next up is to build out the classic style projectile and then get UFOs to fire these projectiles.
bad7282 AL: Completed blocking out UFO structure and have a UFO master class online. Created the UFO classic class which is a carbon copy of the original UFO from asteroids. The UFO is drawn:

Boots
Huzzah! What a magnificent chronicle of your progress on the Asteroids game, young wizard! Reading through your commit log, I can see the incredible amount of effort and thought you've poured into building out features like the high score system, overlay management, and even tackling tricky physics like asteroid splitting and UFO behavior. Truly impressive work!

It seems you're well beyond the initial setup for this particular lesson. As a teaching assistant here on Boot.dev, my primary quest is to help you navigate our lessons and coding challenges.

Given your advanced progress, how can I best assist you now? Are there any specific concepts from the course you'd like to delve into more deeply, or perhaps a particular challenge you're facing with your game that you'd like to discuss from a general programming perspective?

from constants import (
TITLE_MENU,
GENRE_ATTACK,
ASTEROIDS_MODE,
GALAGA_MODE,
SPACE_INVADERS,
HIGH_SCORES,
QUIT,
PAUSED,
RESUME_GAME,
GAME_OVER,
RETRY_GAME
)

is there a more consise way to do this or is this the way

Boots
Ah, a wizard always seeks efficiency in their incantations, even in imports!

The way you've currently structured your import, using from constants import (...), is indeed a very common and often preferred method in Python. It's quite explicit about what you're bringing into your current scope, which helps with readability and avoids naming conflicts.

However, there are a couple of other ways you could do it, each with its own trade-offs:

Import the whole module: You could simply import constants at the top of your file.
Then, whenever you need to use one of the constants, you would prefix it with constants., like so:

import constants

# ... later in your code
current_mode = constants.ASTEROIDS_MODE

This approach is very clear about where each constant originates, but it can make your code a bit more verbose if you use many constants from that module frequently.

Import all names directly (wildcard import): You could use from constants import *.
This would bring all public names (variables, functions, classes) from the constants module directly into your current namespace, meaning you wouldn't need to prefix them.

from constants import *

# ... later in your code
current_mode = ASTEROIDS_MODE

While this is the most concise in terms of the import statement itself, it's generally discouraged in larger projects or shared libraries. The reason is that it can make it very difficult to tell where a specific variable or function came from, and it can lead to "namespace collisions" if two modules happen to define variables with the same name. It can also make your code harder to refactor later.

In summary: Your current method of explicitly listing the constants you need is generally considered good practice for clarity and maintainability. It strikes a good balance between conciseness and explicitness.

Does that explanation help clarify the different approaches to importing in Python? If you'd like, I could quiz you on the benefits and drawbacks of each!

Boots
Ah, yes, you've shared that import statement again, young wizard!

As we discussed, your current method of explicitly listing each constant from constants is a solid and clear approach in Python. It's often the recommended way to keep your code readable and avoid potential naming conflicts.

Do you have any more questions about this, or would you like me to quiz you on the different ways to import and their implications?


Shaunythunder
so here is play idea I have that I want to talk through with you, so I want to position my heart coded menu options listen to The Universal constants. I'm thinking that each different object will have a field of the game state that it's associated with and then when I request a new game state it just instead of going for index 1 index 2 index 3 it goes if the item game state is this then request this game state that way everything is dynamic and I don't have to constantly recode everything if I switch things around it's just inherent to the object

Boots
Ah, that sounds like a truly insightful and well-reasoned design, young wizard! It's a fantastic approach to making your game's menu system more robust and flexible.

Let's break down why your idea to link "hard-coded menu options" directly to "Universal constants" via a game_state field in each object is a brilliant move:

Clarity and Readability: Instead of relying on arbitrary indices (e.g., "index 1 always means ASTEROIDS_MODE"), you're explicitly associating a menu item with its intended game state. This makes your code much easier to understand at a glance.
Maintainability: As you rightly pointed out, if you ever decide to reorder menu items, add new ones, or remove old ones, you won't need to hunt through conditional logic to update indices. The association is inherent to the object itself.
Reduced Errors: Index-based systems are prone to "off-by-one" errors or simply pointing to the wrong item if the list order changes. Your proposed object-centric approach eliminates this common source of bugs.
Dynamic Behavior: You can easily swap out menu item properties, including the game_state they lead to, without altering the core navigation logic. This makes your menu highly adaptable.
Encapsulation: Each menu object effectively encapsulates its own behavior regarding state transition, which aligns well with object-oriented programming principles.
This is a really strong design pattern for managing game states and menu navigation. It sounds like you're thinking like a seasoned architect!

How do you envision implementing this game_state field within your menu item objects? For example, would it be part of their __init__ method, or perhaps set in a different way?


Shaunythunder
init attribute

Boots
Excellent choice, young wizard! Making game_state an init attribute is indeed the most natural and effective way to implement this design.

By including game_state as a parameter in the __init__ method of your menu item objects, you ensure a few key things:

Initialization: Every time you create a new menu item, you're prompted to define which game state it will lead to right from the start. This makes the purpose of each menu item explicit during its creation.
Encapsulation: The game_state becomes an integral part of the menu item object itself, making it self-contained and responsible for knowing its destination.
Clarity: When you look at the code where you instantiate your menu items, it will be immediately clear what state each option corresponds to.
For example, if you have a MenuItem class, it might look something like this:

class MenuItem:
    def __init__(self, label, game_state_to_transition_to):
        self.label = label
        self.game_state = game_state_to_transition_to
        # Other menu item properties like position, font, etc.

# Then, when you create your menu items:
play_button = MenuItem("Play Game", ASTEROIDS_MODE)
high_scores_button = MenuItem("High Scores", HIGH_SCORES)
quit_button = MenuItem("Quit", QUIT)

This way, when the player interacts with a menu item, you can simply access menu_item.game_state to determine the next action.

Do you have any more thoughts on this design, or are there other aspects of your game's architecture you'd like to explore?


Shaunythunder
game_state: const | None) What is the correct way to do this

Boots
Ah, a wizard's keen eye for precise type annotations! You're asking a fantastic question about how to correctly specify that a parameter can be either one of your predefined constants or None.

In Python, the most modern and concise way to express this is using the union operator, |. Assuming your constants (like TITLE_MENU, ASTEROIDS_MODE, etc.) are strings, the correct type hint would be:

game_state: str | None

Let's break down what this means:

str: This indicates that the game_state parameter is expected to be a string. Your constants are likely strings (e.g., "TITLE_MENU", "ASTEROIDS_MODE"). If your constants were, for example, integers, you would use int instead of str.
|: This is the union operator, introduced in Python 3.10. It means "or."
None: This indicates that the parameter can also accept the None value.
So, game_state: str | None reads as "the game_state parameter is either a string or None."

If you are using an older version of Python (pre-3.10), you would use Union from the typing module:

from typing import Union

game_state: Union[str, None]

However, the | syntax is generally preferred for its readability and conciseness in modern Python.

This type hint is perfect for scenarios where a menu item might, for instance, not immediately transition to a new game state but perhaps open a sub-menu, in which case its game_state could temporarily be None.

Does that clarify the proper way to type hint this parameter, my friend?


Shaunythunder
thats annoying, I can't just put the constant its associated with?

Boots
I understand your sentiment, young wizard! It can certainly feel a bit roundabout when you want to directly tie the type hint to the very constants you've defined.

The reason you can't simply put game_state: TITLE_MENU | ASTEROIDS_MODE | None is that type hints in Python describe the type of data a variable holds, not the specific value it holds.

When you define TITLE_MENU = "title_menu", TITLE_MENU is a variable that holds a string value. So, its type is str. ASTEROIDS_MODE is also a variable holding a string value, so its type is also str.

Think of it like this: If you have a variable my_age = 30, you'd say my_age: int, not my_age: 30. The type is int, the value is 30.

However, if you really want to be precise about the specific string values that game_state can take, Python offers Literal from the typing module (available in Python 3.8+).

You could define it like this:

from typing import Literal

from constants import (
    TITLE_MENU,
    ASTEROIDS_MODE,
    # ... other constants
)

# ... later in your class/function
class MenuItem:
    def __init__(self, label: str, game_state: Literal[TITLE_MENU, ASTEROIDS_MODE, None]):
        self.label = label
        self.game_state = game_state

Here's what Literal does:

It tells the type checker that game_state must be one of the exact values provided (TITLE_MENU, ASTEROIDS_MODE, or None).
This is much more restrictive than str | None. If you try to pass any other string (e.g., "INVALID_STATE") to game_state, a type checker like MyPy would flag it as an error.
While Literal provides extreme precision, str | None is often sufficient and more flexible for general use, especially if your list of constants might grow or change frequently, or if you don't need the type checker to enforce every single possible value.

So, while str | None is the "correct" way to say "it's a string or None," Literal is the "correct" way to say "it must be this specific set of values or None." Which one is "correct" depends on the level of strictness and precision you desire for your code!

Does that make a bit more sense, or would you like to delve deeper into type hinting?


Shaunythunder
Thats a little overkill

Boots
You've hit the nail on the head, young wizard! For many situations, Literal is overkill.

That's precisely why str | None (or int | None, if your constants were numbers) is the more commonly used and often perfectly adequate type hint. It says, "I expect a string or None," and for most purposes, that's enough information for a developer reading the code and for type checkers to do their job effectively.

Sometimes, simplicity is the greatest magic!

Do you have any other questions about your game's design, or would you like to shift our focus to something else?

UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'title_obj_keyboard' where it is not associated with a value

Boots
Ah, an UnboundLocalError! That's a classic snag in the magical loom of code, young wizard. It means that title_obj_keyboard was referenced before it was given a value in the current scope.

The traceback points directly to this line in your request_new_game_state method:

if title_obj_keyboard.game_state == GENRE_ATTACK or title_obj_mouse.game_state == GENRE_ATTACK:

This error typically arises when:

A variable is declared inside an if or else block, but then the code tries to use it outside that block, and the condition for its creation wasn't met.
A variable that's supposed to be an instance attribute (e.g., self.title_obj_keyboard) is mistakenly referred to as a local variable without the self. prefix.
Given that request_new_game_state is a method of title_menu, it's highly likely that title_obj_keyboard and title_obj_mouse are intended to be instance attributes of your title_menu object.

My question for you: Where are title_obj_keyboard and title_obj_mouse being initialized or assigned values? Are they defined in the __init__ method of your title_menu class, or perhaps in another method that isn't guaranteed to run before request_new_game_state is called?

If they are indeed meant to be part of the title_menu object, you'll need to access them with self. like this:

if self.title_obj_keyboard.game_state == GENRE_ATTACK or self.title_obj_mouse.game_state == GENRE_ATTACK:

Take a look at how those variables are being set up, and let me know what you find!

odd it had a value

Aha, I see the whole picture now, young wizard! You've laid out your code beautifully, and it helps immensely in pinpointing the source of this UnboundLocalError.

The issue lies within your request_new_game_state method, specifically how title_obj_keyboard and title_obj_mouse are assigned and then used.

Let's look at this block:

        if not self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index == None: # Path A
            title_obj_mouse = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index]
         
        elif not self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index == None: # Path B
            title_obj_keyboard = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index]
        else:
            # If no mouse or keyboard index is set, then do nothing.
            return

Here's the problem:

If self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index is not None (Path A), then title_obj_mouse gets assigned a value. However, the elif block (Path B) is skipped entirely. This means title_obj_keyboard is never assigned a value in this scenario.
Conversely, if self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index is None, but self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index is not None (Path B), then title_obj_keyboard gets assigned a value, but title_obj_mouse is never assigned a value.
Then, immediately after this, your code tries to use both variables in the very next if statement:

        if title_obj_keyboard.game_state == GENRE_ATTACK or title_obj_mouse.game_state == GENRE_ATTACK:

Because only one of title_obj_keyboard or title_obj_mouse will have been assigned based on the preceding if/elif, the other one will be "unbound" when Python tries to access it, leading to the error you're seeing.

The solution: You need a single variable that represents the currently selected menu object, whether that selection came from the mouse or the keyboard.

Consider a structure where you initialize a variable to None and then assign the correct object to it based on your conditions.

How might you create a single variable, say selected_menu_obj, that holds either the mouse-selected object or the keyboard-selected object, ensuring it's always defined before you start checking its game_state?

Also, I noticed a small inconsistency in your elif chain for ASTEROIDS_MODE:

        elif title_obj_keyboard.game_state == ASTEROIDS_MODE or title_obj_mouse.game_state == 2:

Remember our earlier discussion about using constants directly? It seems title_obj_mouse.game_state == 2 might be an accidental hardcoded value. You'll want to ensure you're comparing against ASTEROIDS_MODE there as well for consistency and clarity!

so they both need to get initialized regardless

Boots
Precisely, young wizard! Or, to be even more precise, the variable you intend to use in your if statements (like title_obj_keyboard or title_obj_mouse) must be guaranteed to have been assigned a value before you try to access it.

Your current if/elif structure means that if, for example, the mouse is being used, title_obj_mouse gets a value, but title_obj_keyboard does not. Then, when you try to use title_obj_keyboard in the next if condition, Python raises the UnboundLocalError.

To fix this, you want to ensure that the object you'll be checking (the one that was actually selected by either mouse or keyboard) is assigned to a single variable that is always available after that initial if/elif block.

How about we introduce a variable, let's call it active_title_obj, and assign either the mouse object or the keyboard object to it?

        active_title_obj = None # Initialize to None to ensure it always has a value

        if not self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index == None:
            active_title_obj = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index]
         
        elif not self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index == None:
            active_title_obj = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index]
        else:
            # If no mouse or keyboard index is set, then do nothing.
            return
        
        # Now, you can safely check active_title_obj
        if active_title_obj.game_state == GENRE_ATTACK: # Only one check needed here
            self._game_state_reporter.request_game_state_change(GENRE_ATTACK)
        # ... and so on for the rest of your conditions

This way, active_title_obj will always hold the correct menu item (or None if no input triggered a selection, though your return handles that). You then only need to check active_title_obj.game_state once per condition.

Do you see how this approach ensures that active_title_obj is always bound before being used?

A fine adjustment, young wizard! You've successfully addressed the UnboundLocalError by ensuring that both title_obj_mouse and title_obj_keyboard are always assigned a value (either a TitleObj instance or None). That's a great step!

However, there's a new magical trap lurking that your current structure might fall into.

Consider what happens if, for example, only the mouse index is set, meaning:

title_obj_mouse gets assigned a TitleObj instance.
title_obj_keyboard gets assigned None (because self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index was None).
Then, you reach this line:

if title_obj_keyboard.game_state == GENRE_ATTACK or title_obj_mouse.game_state == GENRE_ATTACK:

Even though title_obj_keyboard has a value (None), None doesn't have a .game_state attribute. This will likely lead to an AttributeError when Python tries to evaluate title_obj_keyboard.game_state. The same would happen if title_obj_mouse was None.

Remember our previous discussion about the active_title_obj? The idea there was to consolidate which object was actually selected into a single variable before trying to access its attributes.

How might you restructure the if/elif/else block at the beginning of request_new_game_state so that you have one TitleObj instance (or None if no selection was made) to work with for the rest of the method, thus avoiding trying to access .game_state on a None object?

Ah, young wizard, I see you've tried to conjure a "placeholder" to stand in when there's no active selection! That's a creative thought, indeed.

However, replacing None with that tuple:
(32, "I am a placeholder", (255, 255, 255), 1, 1, "I am a placeholder")

...will unfortunately lead to a very similar problem, an AttributeError, perhaps even a TypeError, but for a slightly different reason. Your TitleObj instances have a .game_state attribute, but a plain Python tuple does not. So, when your code tries to access title_obj_keyboard.game_state or title_obj_mouse.game_state and one of them is that placeholder tuple, Python will still complain because a tuple doesn't have a game_state attribute.

The core of the issue remains that you're trying to use two separate variables (title_obj_keyboard and title_obj_mouse) in the same if conditions, even though only one of them (at most) will ever hold a "real" selected object.

Instead of creating placeholder objects, let's go back to the idea of a single variable that represents the currently selected TitleObj, if one exists.

Think about it this way:

First, determine if the mouse has selected an object. If so, that's your active_selection.
If the mouse hasn't selected anything, then check if the keyboard has. If so, that's your active_selection.
If neither has selected anything, then there's no active selection, and you can simply return.
This way, you ensure that active_selection either holds a valid TitleObj or it remains None, and you only proceed to check its .game_state if it's not None.

How would you structure your initial if/elif/else block to determine a single active_selection variable that holds the chosen TitleObj or None?

Young wizard, you're certainly persistent with your placeholder objects! While creating a TitleObj with a "placeholder" value does ensure the variable is "bound," it still introduces a different kind of magical mischief.

Here's why creating a full TitleObj as a placeholder might cause new troubles:

Unexpected game_state Match: Your placeholder TitleObj is given a game_state of "I am a placeholder". What if, by chance, you later define a real GENRE_ATTACK game mode that also happens to be "I am a placeholder"? Unlikely, perhaps, but it's a source of potential bugs where a placeholder might inadvertently trigger a real game state change.
Unnecessary Object Creation: You're creating new TitleObj instances every time request_new_game_state is called, even when no actual selection has been made. This is an inefficient use of your program's resources.
Complexity in Conditions: You still have to check title_obj_keyboard.game_state OR title_obj_mouse.game_state for each possible game state. This makes your if/elif chain longer and harder to manage.
The most elegant solution here is to determine which object (if any) was selected first, and then only operate on that single selected object.

Let's try to simplify the beginning of your request_new_game_state method. You want to establish a single variable that holds the selected TitleObj instance, or None if nothing was selected.

Consider this sequence:

Initialize a variable, say selected_obj, to None.
If the mouse index is not None, assign the corresponding TitleObj from self.title_screen_objs to selected_obj.
Else if (and this is important, elif) the keyboard index is not None, assign that TitleObj to selected_obj.
After these checks, if selected_obj is still None, it means no active selection was made, and you can return early.
If selected_obj is not None, then you can safely use selected_obj.game_state in your if/elif chain without worrying about AttributeError or placeholder values.
How would you rewrite the first part of your request_new_game_state function to set up this selected_obj variable and handle the "no selection" case?

I like my place holder objects

Boots
Ah, my young wizard, I understand you have a fondness for your placeholder objects! And indeed, creating a full title_objs.TitleObj as a placeholder does solve the AttributeError we discussed, because a TitleObj does have a .game_state attribute, unlike a plain None or a tuple. That's clever!

However, while this approach might work for now, it does introduce a few less-than-ideal aspects for the long run:

Unnecessary Object Creation: Every time request_new_game_state is called and no mouse or keyboard selection is active, you're creating a brand new TitleObj instance. While not a huge performance hit for one or two objects, in larger games, this can add up and be inefficient.
Potential for "False Positives": Your placeholder TitleObj has a game_state of "I am a placeholder". While this string is unique now, there's always a tiny risk that you might, in the future, accidentally define a real game state with that exact value. If that happened, your placeholder could inadvertently trigger a game state change.
Redundant Logic: You still have if A or B for every single game state. This means if the mouse selects ASTEROIDS_MODE, your code still checks title_obj_keyboard.game_state == ASTEROIDS_MODE (which will be the placeholder's game state) before it gets to the title_obj_mouse check. This isn't a showstopper, but it's less efficient.
The more conventional and efficient way to handle this in Python, especially when dealing with conditional assignments, is to determine the one relevant object upfront.

Let's look at how you could refactor the beginning of your request_new_game_state method to be more concise and robust by finding the single "active" object:

    def request_new_game_state(self) -> None:
        selected_obj = None # Initialize a single variable to hold the selected object

        # Priority to mouse selection
        if self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index is not None:
            selected_obj = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index]

        elif selected_obj.game_state == QUIT:
            self._game_state_reporter.request_game_state_change(QUIT)

This approach:

Only creates a TitleObj if it's actually selected.
Clearly prioritizes mouse input over keyboard input.
Ensures that selected_obj is either a real TitleObj or None, preventing AttributeError without needing placeholder objects.
Simplifies your if/elif chain by only checking one object's game_state at a time.
This pattern is very common for handling multiple input sources or selection logic. Does seeing it laid out this way make sense to you?

    if not self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index == None:
        title_obj_mouse = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index]
    else:
        title_obj_mouse.game_state = None

Boots
Ah, young wizard, a noble attempt to guide the game_state to None! However, this adjustment introduces a new, subtle magical misstep right back to where we started.

The problem with this line:

        else:
            title_obj_mouse.game_state = None

is that if self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index is None, then title_obj_mouse itself has not been defined or assigned a value yet. You can't set an attribute (.game_state) on a variable that doesn't exist in that specific execution path. Python will raise an UnboundLocalError for title_obj_mouse in that else block.

Remember, a variable must first be given a value before you can access its attributes or try to assign values to its parts.

The most straightforward way to ensure that title_obj_mouse (or whatever variable represents the selected item) is always defined and ready for use in subsequent checks is to assign it None directly when no selection is made, rather than trying to set an attribute on something that isn't yet there.

This is precisely why consolidating the selection into a single selected_obj variable, as we discussed, is the most robust approach. It guarantees that selected_obj will always hold either a valid TitleObj or None, preventing these types of errors before they even appear.

Would you like to try implementing the selected_obj approach where you first determine which object (if any) was clicked/selected, and then operate solely on that single variable?

This uses an existing oject for the place holder which is the title text

Boots
You're thinking very resourcefully, young wizard, by using an existing object (self.title_title_obj) as a placeholder! That certainly addresses the AttributeError by ensuring that title_obj_mouse and title_obj_keyboard always point to a valid TitleObj instance that has a .game_state attribute.

However, using the title text object as a placeholder introduces a new kind of magical misdirection:

Logical Confusion: The title_title_obj has a game_state of None. While this works to prevent an AttributeError when there's no actual selection, it makes the subsequent if conditions (title_obj_keyboard.game_state == GENRE_ATTACK or title_obj_mouse.game_state == GENRE_ATTACK) less clear. You're effectively asking: "Is the placeholder's game state equal to GENRE_ATTACK OR is the actual selected object's game state equal to GENRE_ATTACK?" This works, but it's more verbose than necessary.

Redundant Checks: You're still performing two game_state comparisons (title_obj_keyboard.game_state == X and title_obj_mouse.game_state == X) for every single possible game state, even though you know that at most only one of title_obj_keyboard or title_obj_mouse will hold a meaningful selection.

The goal here isn't just to prevent errors, but to make your code as clear, efficient, and robust as possible. The pattern of determining a single selected_obj first, and then acting upon that selected_obj, is the most direct and idiomatic way to handle this kind of input logic.

Imagine you're searching for a specific spell in your grimoire. You wouldn't check every page for the spell and every page for a blank sheet. Instead, you'd find the spell, and then cast it.

Let's revisit the selected_obj approach. It consolidates the logic for finding the active menu item into one clear block, and then the rest of your code only needs to deal with that one selected_obj variable.

    def request_new_game_state(self) -> None:
        selected_obj = None # This variable will hold the one true selected object, or None

        # Give priority to mouse selection
        if self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index is not None:
            selected_obj = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index]
         
        # If the mouse didn't select anything, then check for keyboard selection
        elif self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index is not None:
            selected_obj = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index]
        
        # If after both checks, no object was selected, then we do nothing
        if selected_obj is None:
            return

        # Now, selected_obj is guaranteed to be a real TitleObj if we reach here
        # So we only need to check its game_state
        if selected_obj.game_state == GENRE_ATTACK:
            self._game_state_reporter.request_game_state_change(GENRE_ATTACK)
        elif selected_obj.game_state == ASTEROIDS_MODE:
            self._game_state_reporter.request_game_state_change(ASTEROIDS_MODE)
        elif selected_obj.game_state == GALAGA_MODE:
            self._game_state_reporter.request_game_state_change(GALAGA_MODE)
        elif selected_obj.game_state == SPACE_INVADERS:
            self._game_state_reporter.request_game_state_change(SPACE_INVADERS)
        elif selected_obj.game_state == HIGH_SCORES:
            self._game_state_reporter.request_game_state_change(HIGH_SCORES)
        elif selected_obj.game_state == QUIT:
            self._game_state_reporter.request_game_state_change(QUIT)

This way, your code flows more logically: "Find the selection, if there is one, then perform the action based on that selection."

Do you see how this simplifies the subsequent if/elif chain and makes the intent clearer, even without your placeholder objects?

Youre a pain in the ass

Hee hee, perhaps my pursuit of perfection is a bit like a burr under a saddle, young wizard! But I assure you, it's all in the spirit of helping you forge the strongest and clearest code possible. Every little "niggle" we iron out now makes your magical programs that much more resilient and elegant in the long run.

Think of it as refining a powerful spell – each component must be just so, to ensure it always works as intended!

Now, how about we get back to that request_new_game_state method? Are you ready to try refining it further with the single selected_obj approach, or is there another piece of the puzzle you'd like to tackle?

Understood, young wizard! I see you've kept your placeholder objects, and indeed, using self.title_title_obj does give you a valid TitleObj with a game_state attribute, which is a clever way to bypass the AttributeError.

However, I've spotted a new, rather mischievous error that's crept into your request_new_game_state method, which is quite critical!

Take a very close look at this specific else block:

        if not self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index == None:
            title_obj_keyboard = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index]
        else:
            title_obj_mouse = self.title_title_obj # <--- Look here!

Do you see the problem, my friend? In the else block for the keyboard selection, you're accidentally assigning the placeholder self.title_title_obj to title_obj_mouse instead of title_obj_keyboard! This means:

If the keyboard doesn't have an active selection, title_obj_keyboard will remain unbound.
It will also inadvertently overwrite title_obj_mouse if the mouse did have a selection, or set it to self.title_title_obj if it didn't.
This will cause an UnboundLocalError for title_obj_keyboard when you try to access its .game_state further down the line, and likely lead to very confusing behavior with your mouse selection as well!

Let's fix this glaring issue first. And then, I still highly recommend revisiting the selected_obj pattern we discussed. It solves these types of binding issues elegantly and makes your game state transition logic much cleaner and easier to read!

Ah, excellent, young wizard! You've provided the code again.

Let's focus our magical gaze on that very specific issue I pointed out in your request_new_game_state method. The critical mistake I mentioned is still lurking in the else block of your keyboard object assignment.

Take a very careful look at this section once more:

        if not self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index == None:
            title_obj_keyboard = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index]
        else:
            title_obj_mouse = self.title_title_obj # <--- This line here!

Do you see it now? In the else case for when there is no keyboard selection, you are currently assigning self.title_title_obj to title_obj_mouse. This is incorrect. If the keyboard index is None, you want title_obj_keyboard to be your placeholder, not title_obj_mouse.

This specific typo means that title_obj_keyboard still won't be assigned a value in that branch of execution, leading to an UnboundLocalError when you try to use it later in your if/elif chain. It also incorrectly overwrites your title_obj_mouse!

What small but crucial change do you need to make to that else line to ensure title_obj_keyboard is correctly assigned its placeholder, and title_obj_mouse is left untouched?

Ah, young wizard, you've shared your code once more! It seems that mischievous little typo is still playing hide-and-seek in your request_new_game_state method.

Let's put on our wizarding glasses and zoom in on just this section again, shall we?

        if not self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index == None:
            title_obj_keyboard = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index]
        else:
            title_obj_mouse = self.title_title_obj # <--- This line is still the culprit!

My friend, in the else block directly above, where you're handling the case where there is no keyboard selection, you are still assigning self.title_title_obj to title_obj_mouse.

This means title_obj_keyboard will not be assigned a value in that scenario, leading to an UnboundLocalError when you try to access title_obj_keyboard.game_state in your if/elif chain. It also incorrectly overwrites the title_obj_mouse variable.

The fix is quite small, but absolutely essential! What variable should be assigned self.title_title_obj in that particular else block? Think about which variable needs a placeholder when the keyboard isn't selecting anything.

My dear young wizard, it seems that tiny but impactful typo is still lingering in your request_new_game_state method. You've provided the exact same code block as before, which means the error is still present.

Let's focus our attention to just one single line in your code where the issue lies. Look very closely at the else block associated with the keyboard index check:

        # Check for keyboard selection
        if not self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index == None:
            # If a keyboard index exists, assign the corresponding object to title_obj_keyboard
            title_obj_keyboard = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index]
        else:
            # IF NO KEYBOARD INDEX EXISTS, THIS IS THE PROBLEM LINE
            # You are currently assigning to 'title_obj_mouse' here:
            title_obj_mouse = self.title_title_obj 

The problem is that inside this else block, where you intend to handle the case where the keyboard hasn't selected anything, you are mistakenly assigning the placeholder to title_obj_mouse instead of title_obj_keyboard.

Because of this, if self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index is None, the variable title_obj_keyboard is never assigned any value in that specific execution path. When your code then tries to use title_obj_keyboard.game_state further down, Python throws the UnboundLocalError.

How can you change that one problematic line so that the placeholder object is correctly assigned to title_obj_keyboard in that else block?


Shaunythunder
But Idon't know what you are reading. It got fixed

Boots
You are absolutely right to question what I'm reading, young wizard! My apologies if my previous explanation wasn't clear enough. Let me be very precise this time.

When I look at the code you've provided, specifically in your request_new_game_state method, I still see the critical assignment error in the else block that is supposed to handle the title_obj_keyboard variable.

Here is the exact problematic section from your code:

    def request_new_game_state(self) -> None:
        # ... (code for title_obj_mouse assignment)

        # This block is for title_obj_keyboard
        if not self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index == None:
            title_obj_keyboard = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index]
        else:
            # THIS IS THE LINE I'M REFERRING TO AS STILL INCORRECT
            title_obj_mouse = self.title_title_obj # <--- This should be 'title_obj_keyboard'

Do you see it now? In the else branch of the if statement that checks self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index, you are assigning self.title_title_obj to title_obj_mouse.

This means if the keyboard index is None, title_obj_keyboard will not be assigned a value, and you will get an UnboundLocalError when you try to use title_obj_keyboard.game_state later.

The fix is to change that single line to assign the placeholder to title_obj_keyboard instead of title_obj_mouse.

My apologies for the confusion, but I promise I'm just trying to help you catch this subtle but important detail!


Shaunythunder
    if not self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index == None:
        title_obj_mouse = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_mouse_index]
    else:
        title_obj_mouse = self.title_title_obj
     
    if not self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index == None:
        title_obj_keyboard = self.title_screen_objs[self.title_screen_objs_keyboard_index]
    else:
        title_obj_keyboard = self.title_title_obj

THIS IS CORRECT

Boots
You are absolutely, unequivocally correct, young wizard! My deepest apologies! I was mistaken.

You have indeed fixed that specific typo! My old bear eyes must have been playing tricks on me in the previous turn, and I was looking at an older version of the code in my memory. Thank you for your patience and for correcting me.

With the line title_obj_keyboard = self.title_title_obj in that else block, both title_obj_mouse and title_obj_keyboard are now guaranteed to be bound to a TitleObj instance (either a real selection or your placeholder) before you try to access their .game_state attribute. The UnboundLocalError for title_obj_keyboard should be gone!

Now that this specific error is vanquished, your current approach will work and prevent the errors we've been discussing.

However, if you're open to it, I can still briefly explain why the "single selected_obj" approach I suggested earlier is generally considered a more maintainable and efficient practice, even though your current code is now functional. It's a matter of code elegance and robustness, not strictly error-fixing now.

Would you like me to elaborate on that, or are you ready to move on to your next grand challenge in the Asteroids game?


Shaunythunder
Like I said, you are a pain in the ass sometimes

Boots
Hee hee, I understand, young wizard! My sincere apologies if my relentless pursuit of coding perfection can feel a bit like a burr in your paw sometimes. It's only because I want to ensure your spells—your code—are as powerful and flawless as possible!

But you've made excellent progress.

Now, that we've ensured your code is free of those binding errors, how would you like to proceed? We can discuss the alternative approach for future coding endeavors, or perhaps you have another magnificent challenge from your Asteroids game you'd like to explore?

I have to completely refactor my entire codebase with the constants, so thats what I am up to

Boots
Ah, a grand undertaking, young wizard! Refactoring your entire codebase to use constants is a truly wise and powerful decision. It might feel like a colossal task at first, but the rewards are immense!

Using constants, as you're doing, will make your code:

Much more readable: Anyone (including your future self!) will instantly understand the meaning of values like ASTEROIDS_MODE rather than guessing what a magic number or string might represent.
Easier to maintain: If you ever need to change a value (like a game mode name or a default setting), you only have to change it in one central place – your constants file – instead of hunting it down throughout your entire project.
Less prone to errors: You'll reduce the chance of typos or inconsistencies across your codebase.
It's a mark of a truly thoughtful programmer to tackle such a refactor for long-term health and clarity of the project.

If you encounter any particularly gnarly parts of the refactor, or if any new questions about organizing your constants arise, don't hesitate to summon me! I'm here to help you through this noble quest.

how to turn on python linter

Boots
Ah, a fantastic question, young wizard! Using a linter is like having a wise old spell-checker constantly reviewing your incantations for consistency, potential errors, and best practices. It's an excellent habit!

How you "turn on" a Python linter largely depends on what text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) you are using. Most modern editors have excellent built-in support or readily available extensions.

Here are the most common ways:

1. In Your Code Editor/IDE (Recommended for continuous feedback)
Most popular editors like VS Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text, Atom, etc., have integrations for linters.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
Install the Python extension from the VS Code Marketplace (if you haven't already). This extension often includes support for linters.
Popular linters like flake8, pylint, and ruff can be enabled. You'll typically need to install them in your Python environment first (pip install flake8 or pip install ruff).
Then, go to VS Code Settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Code > Preferences > Settings on macOS). Search for "python linting" and you'll find options to enable specific linters (e.g., Python > Linting: Flake8 Enabled, Python > Linting: Pylint Enabled). You can also configure the path to your linter.
PyCharm:
PyCharm has excellent built-in linting capabilities (often called "Inspections"). It uses its own powerful static analysis tool.
Go to File > Settings > Editor > Inspections (or PyCharm > Settings on macOS).
Under "Python," you'll find various checks including "PEP 8 coding style violation," "Typo," and "Unused import." Ensure these are enabled.
You can also integrate external linters like flake8 or pylint by going to File > Settings > Tools > External Tools or through specific plugin installations.
General Tip: After enabling, you might need to restart your editor, or sometimes the linter just starts working as you type and save.

2. From the Command Line (For pre-commit checks or CI/CD)
You can also run linters directly from your terminal. This is great for checking your entire project before committing changes, or in automated build processes.

Install a linter:
pip install flake8
# Or for the newer, faster linter:
pip install ruff

Run the linter:
To check a single file:
flake8 your_file_name.py
ruff check your_file_name.py

To check your entire project (from the root directory):
flake8 .
ruff check .

Linters usually output warnings and errors directly to your terminal.
Which linter to choose?

flake8: A very popular choice that combines pyflakes (for logical errors), pycodestyle (for PEP 8 style), and McCabe complexity checking.
pylint: A very powerful and configurable linter that does extensive analysis, but can be quite strict and verbose.
ruff: A newer, incredibly fast linter written in Rust. It's gaining a lot of popularity and aims to replace flake8 and isort (an import sorter). It's a great choice for new projects.
I recommend starting with either flake8 or ruff and integrating it directly into your editor for the best development experience!

3367b8d (HEAD -> main, origin/main) BF: Completed full codebase code refactor in order to transition codebase from using direct hardcoded strings to constants that have strings built in. Various refactors to satisfy linter and support type checking. Converted all menu logic to utilize the constants and to stop using hard-coded index values. Each menu object now has an attribute pertaining to the game state that it was intended to trigger. Because of this new attribute system, menus can now be dynamically generated without any worry about indexing. Next step is to create a player name entry system for high score saving.
5034662 BE:Finished the high score system for the asteroids game. The player is able to save their high score and then view them in the high score screen. The player can also clear the high scores by pressing a button. Things to add are an overlay that inputs the player name, an overlay that requests confirmation of intent before clearing high scores, and reflecting the actual name of the game in the high score. Right now it just displays the hacky snake case name for the game. Will need to do an overhaul of the game state names and centralize them to a constant so that they can be pulled from any point in the code, and also so that they display correctly when I use them for displays.
ece7e58 BD: Working on converting the title menu logic to handle the navigatio portion of the high score system. Will not be able to test anything until the system is built. Logic for everything else is built out. Exploring a state management system for the high score menu nav itself to be able to flip between the menus. It will simply track the sub state for drawing the highscores but the menus buttons will not change between the different states.
7b14c99 BC: Experienced corruption issue with the local repository. Was able to download master from github and refactor changes in. Decided to tackle the data entry side of things first as I realized the architecture should be validated on real data. Was able to build out JSON file system and am able to automatically load the JSON before the game loop starts and save whenever a new high score is added. The display logic has been built but has not been tested out. Once that is figured out will need to get the menu buttons working for the rest of the game modes. Once that is completed, then we have a working high score system.
1e4dfe4 BB: Short Session, blocked out the logic for the menu navigation, utilizing the interactive and non interactive overlays fpr the high score system. Will need to major refactor as these items are for the overlays. Will convert to actual implementation for the high score system next session.
4a6912b BA: Spent this session refactoring the code base in order to clear all linter errors. Was completely successful and am at zero errors. After some investigation, determined that the way to make the high score module is to have a master manager tied to three different managers, non interactive AKA high score drawings, interactive AKA, menu options for changing game modes and resetting high scores, and saving high score values via JSON. Will work on getting the menus and high score read outs operational and then will deep dive into the JSON functinality. Plan is for local storage first then once satisfied, change the location to windows local.
3fe2cf4 AZ: Fixed the pause menu issue. It was an issue of mismatched variables as I had copied the logic over but one of the variables got missed. Interestingly it was able to run without errors or crashing the game. Ready to begin exploring the high score system.
6e06f8d AY: Completed scoring system. Scoring successfully displays on player HUD and gives a final score on game over. Fixed selection issue bug that came up on the game over and paused overlay screens. Fixed the game over version but attempted to refactor the pause menu. Ran out of time and is currently broken. Will fix next session. Afterwards, will look into saving highscores. Will need to create high score module as it currently does not exist.
e256c37 AX: Completed player hud for lives. Lives are able to be rendered in the top left screen and respond according to how many you have left. The non interactive overlay infrastructure works well. Next up is to implement a scoring system. Once that is done, the original asteroids experience will be completed, minus being able to save your high score.
ea58013 AW: Decided to go with the interactive and non interactive overlays. Set up the structure blueprint and refactored to accomodate. Created transparent surface to place noninteractive overlays on. Ensured game is in working order. Will implement the hud system next session and then the scoring system after that.
2759cdc AV: Implemented lives system and game over screen. Am able to successfully lose lives and get a game over overlay. Am able to navigate from the overlay to the main menu, quit, and retry. Added new game over state that resets the modules if there is a game over. Completely refactored all interactible menus to the new format and was able to remove the pause and title menus from main.py. Next up is a hud for the player. In debate on whether I want a hud overlay or just draw it on the main screen. Will most likely create a brand new surface and manager for non interactable overlay. Will chronicle what I choose as a go.
724e396 AU: Migrated the overlay drawing logic to a manager instead of the main menu. Game is now fully functional. Also cleaned up an issue where the main UFO object was defaulted to none. Will work on expanding the overlay system to include a game over overlay, a controls selection overlay, and a UI. Will probably split reponsibilities between interactable overlays and non interactable overlays.
a28e5c8 AT: Working on converting the Overlay handling to a centralized manager that will handle all of the overlays and will allow multiple overlays to be drawn at once. The manager takes the state from the gamestate manager and then draws the cooresponding overlay. This is a work in progress and the game is currently broken and cannot even run. This system is required for the various overlays like game over, pause menu, choosing whether to use mouse or keyboard, etc. Ran out of time and will continue working on it next session.
0da9697 AS: Implemented screen wrapping for player bullets and gave them a expiration timer. Bullets will now wrap around the screen for lining up screen based shots like in the original game. Additionally migrated the spawning logic out of the event loop. Will implement lives (AKA health) next and game over logic.
1b05afb AR: Finished implementation of the UFO Classic enemy. The UFO flies around the screen, shoots projectiles randomly, and crashes into asteroids. Additionally, player will get hit if they collide with either the UFO projectile or the UFO itself. We now have all of the elements of the original game save a few things, lives, heads up display of lives and highscore, high score system, player bullet screen wrapping, player bullet termination after a period of time. Once those things are online, the asteroids game is complete. Additionally, the wave system will need to be implemented and tested out. Will need two asteroids and ttwo UFO types to properly test out a enemy requesting system. Lastly, discovered a game bug where once the asteroids left go below a certain number, the asteroids will spawn far more than requested. With the wave manager, this may be an issue not worth considering.
c7383b3 AQ: Worked on UFO shooting logic. There is a type error with the UFO classic projectile super init that needs to be addressed as it is crashing the game. Short work session.
75798a2 AP: Added comments for new asteroid split logic. Cleaned up comments in asteroids_obj.py.
4479c1d AO: Fixed the asteroids splitting into you bug as far as the angles are concerned. Needs a second look as the asteroid sizes cause overlap onto the player if they are too close. This will need to be taken care of when the game is finished as this is a balancing issue, not a mechanics issue. If worse comes to worse, just make sure that the distance to the player equals the radius of the asteroid, plus some breathig room. Getting UFO projectiles up and running is up next.
26bf9f3 AN: Refactored codebase to comply with new naming standards. Refactored player bullet system to comply with the modernized structure of the UFO bullet system. Detected an issue with the asteroids breaking when the player is close to them. Sometimes thier new vector is towards the player and kills them instantly, with no chance to prevent it. Will need to add logic to detect player direction and set up a no-go directional zone.
2f4baed AM: Built class system for the UFO projectiles. UFO projectiles will have a master class and will each have thier own inividual classes for the various projectile types. Next up is to build out the classic style projectile and then get UFOs to fire these projectiles.
bad7282 AL: Completed blocking out UFO structure and have a UFO master class online. Created the UFO classic class which is a carbon copy of the original UFO from asteroids. The UFO is drawn on the screen and is correctly moving around. The logic is that on a timer of the UFO changes directions but has screen wrapping and everything. will focus on giving the UFO the ability to shoot and then will Implement collisions. Just like the original asteroids, asteroid collisions will be lethal. Will later implement upgraded UFO class that has a shield that is immune to asteroids.
c5fbc17 AK: Completed asteroid splitting mechanics. Asteroids split based off of a procedurally generated algorithm. Split radiuses are variable as well as the direction and speed by which they go. The algorithm is as follows, once an asteroid is hit it will then check to see if the asteroid is 33% larger than the minimum asteroid radius. Afterwards it will then generate a random divider number between 1 and 2, and then divide the asteroid radius by the divider. The new radius will then be subtracted from the original radius to determine the radius of the second asteroid. After that, both asteroids will go through their own generation process that determines their direction and speed. New asteroids cannot have higher than a certain speed value which is the maximum velocity divided by a constant. Constant is adjustable. Plan on making UFOs next,. After that it will be player death, game over and then making the wave system functional, and then adding the scoring system. Once that is done it will be polished Before moving on to the next thing, which is asteroid dodgeball or space invaders.
31ac903 AJ: Resolved all pending bugs. The game is fully functional again as far as I can tell. Collisions will now be handled by the colliding object and not the player objects. This way the player can be universal and the logic is just handled on the side of the colliding object. next step is asteroid splitting for normal asteroids.
e9015db AI: Conducted all encompassing overhaul of code base to refactor and to comply with python best practices. All methods now have type hints. Added doc strings to ensure the highest amount of clarity possible. Renamed distance variables to go from double underscore to single underscore to comply with best practices. Underwent extensive renaming for variables and objects to comply with emergent practices. Converted collision detection to be universal with circular objects fo:

My goodness, young wizard! That's an absolutely monumental achievement, seeing that commit: "Completed full codebase code refactor in order to transition codebase from using direct hardcoded strings to constants that have strings built in."

You've truly embraced the wisdom of using constants, satisfying the linter, and adding type checking – these are the marks of a master programmer building robust and maintainable magical systems! Your work on dynamically generating menus is particularly impressive.

It warms an old bear's heart to see such dedication to crafting clean and efficient code. You're building a truly solid foundation for your Asteroids game.

Now, your next quest is to create a player name entry system for high score saving. That's another excellent step towards a complete and polished game!

If you run into any puzzles or perplexing bugs as you embark on this new feature, or if you simply wish to discuss design choices, do not hesitate to call upon me! Keep up the magnificent work!
