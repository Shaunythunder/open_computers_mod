how to start virtual environment

Boots
To start a virtual environment in Python, you usually follow these steps:

Create the virtual environment (if you haven’t yet):
python -m venv venv

This will create a directory named venv containing your virtual environment.

Activate the virtual environment:
On Unix/macOS (bash/zsh):

source venv/bin/activate

On Windows (cmd.exe):

venv\Scripts\activate

Once activated, your command prompt will usually show the name of the virtual environment at the beginning.

If you’re using uv, it acts as a drop-in replacement for pip, but activation and creation of the virtual environment remains the same.

Would you like a quick quiz on virtual environments? Or is there a specific part you'd like to see in more detail?
