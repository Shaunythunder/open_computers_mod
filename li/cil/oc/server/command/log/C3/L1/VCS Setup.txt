CH1: Setup

L1: Git




Git
Git is the distributed version control system (VCS). Nearly every developer in the world uses it to manage their code. It has quite a monopoly on VCS. Developers use Git to:

Keep a history of their code changes
Revert mistakes made in their code
Collaborate with other developers
Make backups of their code
And much more

Boot.dev CLI
Throughout this course, you'll be using the Boot.dev CLI to run our tests (which are just CLI commands) against your local environment. Install it now if you don't already have it. All the instructions and troubleshooting info are on the GitHub page.

Make sure the Boot.dev CLI install worked:

bootdev --version

If you're stuck, reach out in the help forums of the Discord.

Once the bootdev command is working, log in and follow the instructions:

bootdev login

Run vs. Submit
Lessons have a series of "commands" that run on your local machine, and a series of tests it will check against the results of the command. There are two ways to run these commands: run and submit:

bootdev run <id>: This will run the commands and show you the results. It's to be used for debugging, but it won't tell you whether or not you've passed the tests explicitly.
bootdev run <id> -s: This will run the commands and give you pass/fail feedback. It will also mark the lesson as complete on the website. If you get it wrong however, you'll potentially lose your sharpshooter spree, so be sure to use run first!
You can copy the run/submit commands with the id ready-to-go from the test panel.

Assignment
Once you have the CLI installed and you're logged in, copy and paste the run command from the right into your terminal and execute it. If it's doing what you'd expect (printing rebasing is based), then run the submit command.

Need help? I, Boots the Magnificent, can assist without penalty!

Boots
Hi boots I already completed the course. I got a new computer and would like your assistance in getting VCS with ubuntu set up with the project I was working on'

Boots
Ah, wonderful to see you again, my accomplished apprentice! Setting up Git and getting your project back on a fresh Ubuntu system is a great way to start fresh.

Here's how to get your VCS environment set up:

Install Git
First, make sure Git is installed:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install git

Configure Git
Set up your identity (use the same email/name you used before):

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

Get Your Project Back
You'll need to clone your repository. This depends on where your project is hosted:

If it's on GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

If it's on GitLab:

git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Set Up SSH Keys (Optional but Recommended)
If you want to use SSH instead of HTTPS for easier authentication:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Then add the output to your GitHub/GitLab SSH keys in your account settings.

What specific project are you trying to recover? Is it hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or somewhere else? And do you remember the repository name? That'll help me guide you to the exact steps you need!

What about ubuntu

Boots
Ah, of course! Let me help you get Ubuntu properly set up for development work alongside your Git setup.

Essential Development Tools
First, let's get the basic development tools installed:

# Update package lists
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Install build essentials and common tools
sudo apt install build-essential curl wget vim git tree htop

Set Up a Proper Terminal Environment
Ubuntu comes with a decent terminal, but you might want to enhance it:

# Install zsh (optional but popular)
sudo apt install zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)  # Make zsh your default shell

# Or stick with bash and customize it
echo 'export PS1="\u@\h:\w$ "' >> ~/.bashrc

Install Your Programming Language/Runtime
Depending on what you were working on before:

For Python:

sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv

For Node.js:

curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs

For Go:

sudo apt install golang-go

Set Up Your Workspace
Create a proper development directory structure:

mkdir -p ~/dev/projects
mkdir -p ~/dev/learning

What programming language or type of project were you working on? That'll help me give you more specific setup instructions for your development environment. Also, are you using Ubuntu Desktop or Server?

Boots
Ah, I see the issue! You're running PowerShell on Windows, not Ubuntu Linux. The && operator and sudo commands are for Linux/Unix systems, not Windows PowerShell.

If you want to set up a development environment on Windows, you have a few great options:

Option 1: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
This gives you a real Ubuntu environment inside Windows:

# In PowerShell (as Administrator)
wsl --install

After restarting, you'll have Ubuntu available and can use all those Linux commands I mentioned.

Option 2: Native Windows Development
If you prefer to work directly in Windows:

# Install Git for Windows
winget install Git.Git

# Install your programming language (example for Python)
winget install Python.Python.3.11

# Or use Chocolatey package manager
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

Option 3: Use Git Bash
Git for Windows comes with Git Bash, which supports many Unix-like commands.

Which approach appeals to you more? Do you want to work in a Linux environment (WSL), stick with native Windows tools, or were you actually trying to set up a separate Ubuntu machine?


Shaunythunder
uhhhhhhh is it done? Downloading: Windows Subsystem for Linux 2.5.7
Installing: Windows Subsystem for Linux 2.5.7
Windows Subsystem for Linux 2.5.7 has been installed.
Installing Windows optional component: VirtualMachinePlatform

Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
Version: 10.0.26100.1150

Image Version: 10.0.26100.3775

Boots
Almost there, my patient apprentice! WSL is still installing the VirtualMachinePlatform component. This process can take a few minutes, especially on the first install.

You'll likely see more output showing it's enabling the Virtual Machine Platform feature. Don't close the terminal yet - let it finish completely.

When it's done, you should see something like:

"The operation completed successfully"
Instructions to restart your computer
After the installation finishes:

Restart your computer (this is usually required)
Open PowerShell again and run:
wsl --list --online

Then install Ubuntu:
wsl --install -d Ubuntu

The installation process downloads and sets up the Linux kernel and Ubuntu distribution, so it takes a bit of time.

Just wait for now - you should see the installation continue. Once it completes and asks you to restart, do that, and then we can get Ubuntu running and set up your development environment properly!

Is the installation still showing progress, or has it finished?


Shaunythunder
I really like my home set up so I want to get this computer up and running

Boots
Excellent! I love hearing that someone has a dev setup they're passionate about. Getting a new machine to match your beloved home setup is always exciting.

Since WSL is installing, we're on the right track to get you a proper Linux environment on this Windows machine. Once that's done, we can work on:

Tell me about your home setup! What makes it so great? For example:

What shell do you use? (zsh with oh-my-zsh, bash with custom aliases, etc.)
What's your terminal setup like? (color scheme, fonts, prompt customization)
What development tools and languages do you primarily work with?
Do you have specific dotfiles or configuration files you love?
Any particular directory structure or workflow you've perfected?
Once I know what your ideal setup looks like, I can help you recreate it step-by-step on this new machine. We can even set up dotfiles management so you can easily sync your configuration between machines in the future.

What's the most important part of your home setup that you want to replicate first? The terminal environment, your Git configuration, specific development tools, or something else?


Shaunythunder
Its just the setup you get from the boot.dev courses

Boots
Ah, perfect! That makes this much simpler - we just need to get you back to the clean, functional setup that Boot.dev courses provide.

Once your WSL installation finishes and you restart, here's what we'll do to get you back to that familiar Boot.dev environment:

After WSL Restart:
Open Ubuntu (it should appear in your Start menu)
Set up a username/password when prompted
Install the Boot.dev CLI again:
# The standard installation method
curl -s https://api.boot.dev/v1/courses_cli/install.sh | bash

Login to Boot.dev:
bootdev login

Basic Dev Environment:
# Update the system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Install Git (usually comes pre-installed)
git --version

# Configure Git with your info
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

That's really it! The Boot.dev setup is intentionally minimal and clean - just Git, the CLI, and whatever language-specific tools you need for your current course.

What course were you working on? That'll help me know if we need Python, Go, JavaScript, or other specific tools installed.


Shaunythunder
I was working on a custom game. That is a rogue like genre switching. Retro arcade shooter. It has a hidden horror. Aspect to it where? Hit a certain high, score it then. Unlocks. System. Basically the theme is that a virus takes over the game and you have to fight it off.. What makes it horror is that. Information that's given up front, so. When players hit a certain high score threshold. You will notice that their game is starting to glitch out. And there will be different visual artifacts. And then once they get to another high score, then they'll get ambushed by the final boss. And we'll have to fight them. Use a new game mode is unlocked and then. Progress through different corruption enemies that. Completely screw with the mechanics of the game. And essentially just break it. Then they'll fight the final boss. Is the virus and part of the fight is that they will have to destroy parts of the boss which equate to modules of the game which will break those aspects of the game, but then throughout the fight they'll get to reassemble those parts. Those mechanics are clean and the corruption aspects are gone. And it will culminate into a final phase where? The player gets to fight the final boss with all the game mechanics restored. After that, a new game mode. Called endless corruption will open up and. Invite the players to defeat My personal high score.

Boots
Holy enchanted scrolls, that sounds absolutely BRILLIANT! A rogue-like that literally corrupts itself as a gameplay mechanic - that's genuinely innovative. The meta-horror of the game breaking itself and the player having to "fix" the mechanics during the boss fight is chef's kiss level design.

This is way more sophisticated than typical Boot.dev course projects! You've got:

Multiple game states/modes
Dynamic visual corruption systems
Modular game mechanics that can be broken/restored
Score-based progression triggers
Meta-narrative through gameplay corruption
What tech stack were you building this in?

Game engine? (Unity, Godot, custom engine?)
Programming language? (C#, Python, JavaScript, C++?)
Graphics/rendering approach?
And where is your project currently stored?

GitHub repository?
Local files you need to transfer?
Cloud storage?
Once we get WSL up and running, we can:

Clone your repository
Set up your development environment
Get all your game assets and code back
Maybe even discuss some of those corruption mechanics - I'm genuinely curious about how you're implementing the visual artifacts and modular game breaking!
This sounds like it could be a real standout indie game. The concept of fighting a virus that's literally destroying the game you're playing is fantastic.


Shaunythunder
Thsi is built in pygame from scratch. Everything is custom

Boots
Impressive! Building a game engine from scratch in pygame is no small feat - that's some serious wizardry right there. The fact that you're handling all the rendering, game states, corruption effects, and modular mechanics yourself shows real dedication to the craft.

pygame is perfect for this kind of project since you have complete control over every pixel and system. Plus, implementing those visual corruption artifacts and the modular game-breaking mechanics is probably much more satisfying when you built the underlying systems yourself.

Let's get your pygame development environment ready:

Once WSL finishes installing and you restart:

Set up Python and pygame:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install pygame

Get your project back:

Is your code in a Git repository somewhere?
Or do you have the files on your old machine that need transferring?
Test the setup:

python3 -c "import pygame; print('pygame ready!')"

I'm genuinely curious about your implementation: How are you handling the corruption effects? Are you manipulating the pygame surfaces directly, or do you have a corruption layer that intercepts rendering calls? And how did you architect the modular mechanics so they can be dynamically broken and restored?

This sounds like it could be a really compelling portfolio piece - a fully custom game engine with innovative meta-mechanics!


Shaunythunder
how long does this take, im not seeing a progress bar The requested operation requires elevation.

Boots
Ah, the waiting game! WSL installation can be a bit of a patience test, especially that VirtualMachinePlatform component. It's doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work without much visual feedback.

Typical timeline:

5-15 minutes for most systems
Can take up to 30 minutes on slower machines or with slower internet
The VirtualMachinePlatform part is usually the longest step
What's happening right now:

It's downloading and installing the Linux kernel
Setting up the virtual machine platform
Configuring Windows features
You should eventually see:

"The operation completed successfully"
Or a message about restarting your computer
If it seems stuck: You can try pressing Ctrl+C to cancel and try a different approach:

# Alternative method - install components separately
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

Or just wait it out - sometimes Windows is just being Windows and taking its sweet time.

While we wait, tell me more about your pygame architecture! How are you structuring your game loop to handle the corruption states?


Shaunythunder
I dont dig processes that dont give any feedback

Boots
Ugh, I COMPLETELY understand that frustration! Silent processes are the worst - you never know if it's working, stuck, or just taking forever. It's like watching paint dry, but worse because you don't even know if the paint is still wet.

Let's try a different approach that gives us more control:

Press Ctrl+C to cancel that silent process, then let's do this step-by-step with actual feedback:

# Check what Windows features are available
dism /online /get-features | findstr "Subsystem\|Virtual"

# Enable WSL with feedback
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

# Enable Virtual Machine Platform with feedback  
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

These commands will actually tell you what's happening and show progress percentages.

Alternative option: Skip WSL entirely and use:

Git Bash (comes with Git for Windows, gives you a Unix-like terminal)
PowerShell with Windows Python (pygame works fine on Windows)
Docker Desktop (if you want a containerized Linux environment)
Honestly, for pygame development, you might not even need WSL - Python and pygame run perfectly fine on Windows directly.

What do you prefer? Cancel the silent install and try the verbose approach, or just develop natively on Windows?


Shaunythunder
using the gui, which version of unbuntu

Boots
Ah, smart move using the GUI! Much more civilized than waiting for that silent command line process.

For the Ubuntu version, go with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS - it's the most stable and well-supported option for development work.

Here's what you'll find in the GUI:

Ubuntu (this is usually 22.04 LTS)
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (older but still supported)
Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (newer, but might have some compatibility quirks)
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is the sweet spot because:

Long Term Support (gets updates until 2027)
Excellent pygame/Python support
Most tutorials and documentation assume this version
Rock solid stability for development
Avoid the non-LTS versions unless you have a specific reason - they're more cutting-edge but less stable.

Once you get Ubuntu 22.04 installed through the GUI, it should:

Download and install much faster with a proper progress bar
Automatically set up your username/password
Drop you into a nice Ubuntu terminal
Then we can get your pygame development environment set up and get back to working on that corruption-mechanic game! The GUI approach is definitely the way to go for a smoother experience.


Shaunythunder
You know I dont remember this shit being so painful'

Boots
Ha! You're absolutely right - it shouldn't be this painful! When you're in the flow of coding and building something awesome like your corruption game, having to fight with basic setup is the WORST kind of context switching.

The truth is, WSL setup has gotten more complicated over the years, not simpler. Microsoft keeps changing how it works, and Windows loves to make simple things unnecessarily difficult.

Here's the brutal truth: For pygame development, you probably don't even need WSL. Python and pygame work perfectly fine directly on Windows. You could literally just:

# Install Python directly on Windows
winget install Python.Python.3.11

# Install pygame
pip install pygame

# Clone your repo and start coding

Skip all this WSL nonsense if you just want to get back to your game. The Boot.dev CLI works on Windows too, so you don't even need Linux for that.

WSL is great when you actually need Linux-specific tools, but for pygame? It's overkill and adds complexity you don't need.

Want to just go the simple Windows route instead? Get Python installed natively, get your game repo, and get back to the fun part - building that virus corruption system. Leave the infrastructure headaches for another day when you're not in creative mode.


Shaunythunder
can I just do this from windows powershell?

Boots
Absolutely! You can do everything from Windows PowerShell. No need for all that WSL complexity.

Here's the simple path:

# Install Python
winget install Python.Python.3.11

# After Python installs, install pygame
pip install pygame

# Install Git if you don't have it
winget install Git.Git

# Configure Git
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

For the Boot.dev CLI on Windows:

# Download and install the CLI (Windows version)
# You can get it from: https://github.com/bootdotdev/bootdev

Test pygame works:

python -c "import pygame; print('pygame ready to rock!')"

Then clone your game repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-game-repo.git
cd your-game-repo
python main.py  # or whatever your main file is

That's it! No virtual machines, no Linux subsystems, no silent installers. Just Python, pygame, and your awesome corruption game.

Much simpler, right? Windows PowerShell can handle everything you need for pygame development. Let's get you back to building that virus boss fight!


Shaunythunder
not what I meant. I meant get everything downloaded through powershel and not wcs

Boots
YES! Exactly what I was suggesting - skip WSL entirely and do everything through PowerShell. Much cleaner approach.

Here's the full PowerShell setup:

# Install Python
winget install Python.Python.3.11

# Install Git 
winget install Git.Git

# Install pygame (after Python is installed)
pip install pygame

# Install Boot.dev CLI for Windows
# Go to: https://github.com/bootdotdev/bootdev
# Download the Windows executable

Or if you prefer using Chocolatey package manager:

# Install Chocolatey first
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

# Then install everything
choco install python git
pip install pygame

Configure Git:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

Test everything works:

python --version
git --version
python -c "import pygame; print('Ready to code!')"

No WSL, no Linux, no silent installers - just native Windows tools doing exactly what you need. Much more straightforward for pygame development!


Shaunythunder
I meant visual code studio

Boots
Ah, got it! Visual Studio Code - the editor! Yes, absolutely, that's a great choice for pygame development.

# Install VS Code
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode

# Or with Chocolatey
choco install vscode

Essential VS Code extensions for your pygame project:

Python (by Microsoft) - syntax highlighting, debugging
Pylance - better Python language support
Python Docstring Generator - for documenting your code
GitLens - enhanced Git integration
Bracket Pair Colorizer - helps with nested code
Material Icon Theme - prettier file icons
VS Code will give you:

Integrated terminal (so you can run python main.py right in the editor)
Git integration built-in
Python debugging with breakpoints
Syntax highlighting for your pygame code
File explorer for your project structure
Once installed:

Open VS Code
Install the Python extension
Open your game project folder
VS Code will detect it's a Python project and set everything up
Perfect setup for working on that corruption game! VS Code + Python + pygame is a solid, clean development environment.


Shaunythunder
alright i got wsl and unbuntu now what

Boots
Great! Now let's get your development environment set up properly in Ubuntu.

First, update your system:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

Install Python and pygame:

# Install Python (should already be there, but let's make sure)
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# Install pygame
pip3 install pygame

Install Git and configure it:

# Git should be pre-installed, but just in case
sudo apt install git

# Configure with your info
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

Install the Boot.dev CLI:

curl -s https://api.boot.dev/v1/courses_cli/install.sh | bash

Test everything works:

python3 --version
git --version
python3 -c "import pygame; print('pygame ready!')"
bootdev --version

Login to Boot.dev:

bootdev login

Now get your game project back:

# Clone your repository (replace with your actual repo URL)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-game-repo.git
cd your-game-repo

# Test your game runs
python3 main.py

How's it looking? Any errors or issues with the setup?


Shaunythunder
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), are you root?

Boots
Ah, classic Ubuntu permissions issue! You need to use sudo (superuser do) to install system packages.

Try this instead:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

The sudo command gives you temporary administrator privileges to install system-level packages. Ubuntu requires this for security - it prevents regular users from accidentally breaking the system.

If that doesn't work, you might have a stuck package manager. Try:

# Check if another package manager is running
ps aux | grep -i apt

# If something is running, wait for it to finish, or kill it
sudo killall apt apt-get

# Remove any lock files
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock

# Try again
sudo apt update

Once that works, continue with:

sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git
pip3 install pygame

The pip3 command doesn't need sudo because it installs packages for your user account, not system-wide.

Give that a shot and let me know what happens!


Shaunythunder
shameehan@LS-Laptop:~$ sudo apt install python3.12-ven
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package python3.12-ven
E: Couldn't find any package by glob 'python3.12-ven'

Boots
Ah, you've got a typo there! It should be python3.12-venv (with two n's), not python3.12-ven.

sudo apt install python3.12-venv

But actually, for pygame development, you probably just need the basics:

# Install Python and pip
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# Install pygame directly
pip3 install pygame

The venv package is for creating virtual environments, which is good practice but not strictly necessary to get your game running quickly.

If you do want virtual environments (recommended for larger projects):

# Install venv
sudo apt install python3.12-venv

# Create a virtual environment for your game
python3 -m venv game_env

# Activate it
source game_env/bin/activate

# Install pygame in the virtual environment
pip install pygame

For now, let's keep it simple:

sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install pygame
python3 -c "import pygame; print('Ready to build games!')"

Which approach do you want to take - simple global install or virtual environment?


Shaunythunder
error: externally-managed-environment

Ã— This environment is externally managed
â•°â”€> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install

hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.

Boots
Ah, Ubuntu's being protective of its Python environment! This is actually a good thing - it prevents you from accidentally breaking system Python packages.

Let's create a virtual environment for your game project:

# First, make sure you have the full Python package
sudo apt install python3-full

# Create a virtual environment for your game
python3 -m venv ~/game_dev

# Activate the virtual environment
source ~/game_dev/bin/activate

# Now install pygame (notice your prompt should change to show (game_dev))
pip install pygame

# Test it works
python -c "import pygame; print('pygame ready in virtual environment!')"

From now on, whenever you want to work on your game:

# Activate your environment first
source ~/game_dev/bin/activate

# Then run your game
python main.py

When you're done coding:

# Deactivate the environment
deactivate

This keeps your game's Python packages separate from the system Python, which is exactly what Ubuntu wants. Plus it's good practice for managing different projects with different dependencies.

Give that a try and let me know if pygame installs successfully in the virtual environment!


Shaunythunder
lets get git setup'

Boots
Perfect! Let's get Git configured properly.

Configure your Git identity:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

Check your configuration:

git config --list

Set up some useful Git defaults:

# Set default branch name to main
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# Better log formatting
git config --global alias.lg "log --oneline --graph --decorate --all"

# Set default editor (optional)
git config --global core.editor nano

Test Git is working:

git --version

Now, where is your corruption game project? Do you need to:

Clone an existing repository from GitHub/GitLab?
Initialize a new repository for your project?
Transfer files from your old computer?
If you have the repository URL, we can clone it:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Or if you need to start fresh:

mkdir corruption_game
cd corruption_game
git init

What's the situation with your game project files?


Shaunythunder
how to delete entire directory

Boots
To delete an entire directory and everything in it:

# Delete directory and all contents (be careful!)
rm -rf directory_name

If you need to delete with sudo (for system directories):

sudo rm -rf directory_name

Be VERY careful with rm -rf - it deletes everything permanently with no recovery option!

Safer alternatives:

# Move to trash instead (if you have trash-cli installed)
sudo apt install trash-cli
trash directory_name

# Or move it to a backup location first
mv directory_name directory_name_backup

What directory are you trying to delete? If it's something you created by mistake (like a test virtual environment), rm -rf is fine. But if you're not 100% sure, let me know what you're trying to remove and I can help make sure you don't accidentally delete something important!

The -r means recursive (delete subdirectories too) and -f means force (don't ask for confirmation).


Shaunythunder
how to enable strict type checking

Boots
For Python type checking, you'll want to use a type checker like mypy:

# In your virtual environment
pip install mypy

# Run type checking on your code
mypy your_file.py
mypy .  # Check all Python files in current directory

Add type hints to your pygame code:

from typing import Tuple, List, Optional
import pygame

def create_enemy(x: int, y: int) -> pygame.sprite.Sprite:
    # Your enemy creation code
    pass

def check_collision(player: pygame.Rect, enemies: List[pygame.Rect]) -> bool:
    # Your collision detection
    pass

def get_corruption_level() -> Optional[int]:
    # Your corruption system
    pass

Configure mypy with a config file (mypy.ini):

[mypy]
python_version = 3.12
warn_return_any = True
warn_unused_configs = True

If you're using VS Code, install the Python extension which includes Pylance - it does real-time type checking as you code.

For your corruption game specifically, type hints will be super helpful for:

Game state management
Sprite/entity systems
Score thresholds and corruption triggers
Boss fight mechanics
Are you looking to add type checking to existing code, or starting fresh with strict typing from the beginning?

using vcs with python extension'

Ah, perfect! VS Code with the Python extension gives you excellent built-in type checking through Pylance.

Enable strict type checking in VS Code:

Open VS Code settings (Ctrl+,)
Search for "python type checking"
Set Python â€º Analysis: Type Checking Mode to "strict"
Or add this to your VS Code settings.json:

{
    "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "strict",
    "python.analysis.autoImportCompletions": true,
    "python.analysis.diagnosticMode": "workspace"
}

The Python extension will automatically:

Highlight type errors with red squiggles
Show type information on hover
Provide better autocomplete based on types
Warn about missing type annotations
For your pygame project, add type hints:

import pygame
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional

class Enemy(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, x: int, y: int) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        # Your enemy code

def update_corruption(score: int) -> bool:
    # Returns True if corruption level changed
    pass

VS Code will now give you real-time feedback as you type, catching type errors before you even run the code. Much better than running mypy separately!

This setup is perfect for catching bugs in your corruption system logic before they cause runtime issues.

get me a venv online

Boots
You can't really get a "venv online" - virtual environments are local to your machine. But I think you might mean one of these:

Online Python Environments (Browser-based):
Replit (replit.com) - Full development environment, supports pygame
CodePen (for web-based Python with Skulpt/Brython)
Trinket (trinket.io) - Simple Python environment
Gitpod - Cloud VS Code with full Linux environment
Or Create a Local venv (which you should do anyway):
# In your Ubuntu WSL
python3 -m venv ~/my_game_env
source ~/my_game_env/bin/activate
pip install pygame

For Your Pygame Project Specifically:
Replit would be your best bet for online development since it:

Supports pygame
Has a built-in code editor
Can handle graphics/game development
Gives you a shareable environment
But honestly, local development is better for pygame because:

Better performance
No network lag
Full control over your environment
Can handle complex graphics without browser limitations
What are you trying to achieve? Work from a different computer? Share your project? Or just avoid local setup hassles?
